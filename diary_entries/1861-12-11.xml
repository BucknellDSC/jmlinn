            <p>The morning was dark and lowering, &amp; the forenoon passed with wind and rain.
               This afternoon cleared brightly, &amp; though somewhat windy, it was beautiful I
               was notified that I was appointed Judge Advocate in a Court of Inquiry demanded by
               Lt Col Vignier de Monteil of the New York 53rd commonly known as the D'Epineuil
               Zoaves, on charges proffered against him by his Colonel D'Epineuil &amp; Cap W.W.
               Armstrong of the same Regt. The charges are unofficer-like conduct, getting drunk
               &amp; speaking disrespectfully of Col D'Epineuil - among the rest that he
               D'Epineuil had never seen service - never anything but a common sailor - also that
               he ate breakfast at the same table with his orderly. This Regiment dresses the
               same as the French imperial Zouaves - blue jacket trimmed with yellow, blue scarf
               around the waist, skyblue pants - bagging down to the knees - Tom Grier asked <pb
                  facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary04.jpg"/>
               <fw>Camp Union near Annapolist Md. December 11 Wednesday continued 1861.</fw> one
               the other day whether he couldnt carry ten days rations int he seat of his
               pantaloons - white leggings. Tom took the notices of the Court of Inquiry over to
               D'Epineul - he saw his wife, a buxom french woman dressed in the full Zouave
               costume. </p>
            <p>We have a little black pup belonging to some one in the Regiment. He is called
               General, and is very playful. During the solemnity of the Dress parade, he got
               after the heels of Lt. Morris, acting adjutant - then he treed the Colonel, and
               wound up with biting the heels of the Band, when they were beating off. The butler
               arrived this evening &amp; began by distributing a piece of tobacco to the boys.
               There was a grand rush - for they were nearly starved for it. It has caused great
               rejoicing, as they think it an end to their troubles, &amp; especially as they
               were notified at dress parade that the paymaster would be along soon. Beaver went
               to town - to attend meeting I suppose.</p>
