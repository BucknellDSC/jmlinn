            <dateline>Camp Union, Near Annapolis<lb/> 
               December 13 Friday. 1861.</dateline>
            <p>This was a bright fine day, clear but cold. I went to the Court of Inquiry. The
               examination of Capt. Gilmore was concluded - then a sergt was examined and winding
               up with Maj. Cantel. Maggi was very impertinent &amp; thought himself very cute.
               Maj. Legendre was calm &amp; passive. Maj. Cantel with his dumpy figure and
               rat-tail mustache got excited when Maggi asked him whether he considered himself
               competent to judge of the capacity of the Lt.Col. When we adjourned the french and
               Italian had a vigorous onslaught of words. They stood up to each other in the
               position of a soldier, &amp; blathered away, it was quite amusing. I got out in
               time to see the Division reviewed by Ge Foster - 8th Connecticut, 51st New York,
               51st Pennsylvania, 53rd New York. D'Epineuil Zoauves. The Connecticut were a
               [spiraling?] looking [sett?] - about 500 - New York were another fine looking
               [sett?] But the 57th Pennsylvania was the finest of all - better looking men,
               finer marching and the only Regiment that went through the review in proper form.
               The D'Epineuil Zoauves looked well - but they had a comical looking Drum Major,
               with an immense bear skin hat, &amp; a band that sounds like a dutch organ, &amp;
               a drum corps which was simply ridiculous. Our regiment passed in fine style &amp;
               passed once in review at double quick. The flat at the place where the Reviewing
               Officer stood was once carried by the 4th Connecticut at Bulls run, by Capt
               Fowler's Company, now in the 8th Connecticut. It has several bullet holes through
               it. An officer told me that it disappeared during the fight, &amp; they afterwards
               found that the carrier had skulked and hid it in the fence corner. There were
               several ladies on the field - one particularly handsome. It is quite a treat to
               see ladies. Our camp looked very beautiful from the field of review. Tomorrow the
               Division is to be reviewed by Gen Burnside, consisting of the two brigades 10th
               Connecticut 22nd 23rd 27th Mass in the first Brigade. The twenty fourth Mass
               arrived at the Navy Yard this morning in the steamer Admiral.</p>
