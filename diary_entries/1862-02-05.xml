            <dateline>Wednesday Feb 5</dateline>
            <p>It was bright and clear this morning and cold , continued so all day. The first
               brigade got under way about eight o’clock, and the second Brigade about nine
               o’clock. The Northerner first, with three schooners in tow, George Peabody with
               two schooners, and next the Cossack, with the Scout in tow. We watched with
               interest the Commodore lead out past the point followed by the gun boats, and when
               it headed Northward we felt assured our destination was Roanoke Island. It was a
               beautiful sight to see the fleet steaming slowly up the sound, the waters
               sparkling in the brilliant sunshine. The air cold and clear. So they continued all
               day long, making scarcely more than three miles an hour. We dined at four o’clock
               and went on deck, as usual to watch the sunset. Stumpy point was in eight. A low
               range of trees marked the marshy shore to the left, and over it down back of us,
               the splendid arch that crowned the sun as he sank down, was as fine as any I ever
               saw. The red had not yet left the sky, before we came opposite Stumpy point. The
               American flag run up the foremast of the Patuxeut, our anchor dropped, and we left
               the deck. Not before we saw the gunboats range themselves as usual out beyond us,
               our bulwark and safety. The Scout came floating up along side, our comrades of
               that ilk were gathered on the sides and shrouds, as we were gathered on the side
               next them, and a lively conversation ensued, Scout. “Bring back those hams you
               stole” Cossack. “Where are the hospital towels. Scout. You can sleep on the
               hurricane deck if you come over here.” Cossack. Where’s the quartermaster’s
               whiskey.” Scout we can accommodate you in the dirty gangways, as you did us.”
               Cossack you weren’t fit to sleep any place else.” &amp; so it went on with banter
               and test. The allusions were to the fact that when the Scouters came on board here
               the other day and during their stay forty five dollars worth of ham, belonging to
               the officer of the Scouters was stolen as also beef tongue &amp;c. And our
               hospital stores were broken open and fifteen towels taken, and a barrel of whiskey
               belonging to Uncle Sam. Tapped. Money was also stolen. We were unable to tell
               whose crew did it but in a bantering way each accused the other of it: Each
               alledging that there was no thieving in either vessel until they all got together
               on board the Cossack. Frank [Rizetdly], artist for the Lon Illust news, a
               correspondent of Lon Times, and Frank Leslies artist are on board the Spaulding. I
               heard of Frank [Rizetdly] being at Centreville but did not see him. I should like
               to see him, because I commenced taking the Lon Illust News first at the beginning
               of the Italian war &amp; he illustrated that and afterwards the Sicilians war</p>
