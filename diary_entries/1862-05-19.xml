            <dateline>Monday 19th </dateline>
            <p>It was very warm during the day, and the evening we had a severe shower. I sent
               a scouting party to hunt up Phillips. Just after they left word came to us that
               he was in the guard house of the 10th Conn. about 4 miles from here, on our
               outposts evidently deranged. He had been put in the guard house the day before
               and released. During the night he was captured again &amp; I believe knocked
               down by the sentry. He said that we were going to shoot him, and he wanted to
               get in to the rebel lines. We sent an ambulance after him &amp; brought him
               back. The Dr. has had a blister on the back of his neck. We have got into a
               pretty difficulty. It appears that Shorkley wrote to his brother stating that
               he was glad Lt Kelly wasn’t along at Camden, for he might have been discredited
               &amp; his brother was impudent enough to show it and Stenner wrote demanding an
               explanation. Shorkley took the bull by the horns, and acknowledged he did write
               it &amp; would stick to it. There was no Co K in the battle - some few of the
               company were there. Then to cap it the Chronicle has been rifling my private 
               <pb facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary69.jpg"/>
               letters or journal and says the only mention of Co K was that Capt Linn saw
               Michael Shires on the field - evidently meaning to show that the Co was there,
               but they in connection with the other, interpret that I mean to say nobody but
               Shires of that company was there. It annoys me exceedingly that our folks
               should be so impudent as to exhibit it. I warned them frequently about it and
               now they have got me in to a miserable scrape. Shorkley wrote his brother that
               he would confine his correspondence to brief matters. I’ll confine mine to my
               health. </p>
