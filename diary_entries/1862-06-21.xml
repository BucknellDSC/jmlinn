            <dateline>June 21. Saturday 1862. </dateline>
            <p>It was a warm pleasant day. Lt Col Joshua K Sigfried 48 P. came here to make
               his affidavit for back pay a very pleasant gentlemanly man. There are many good
               things happen in camp that need the surroundings to fully appreciate.
               Bachenheimer is a little fellow in my company, they call him a Jew - he is a
               printer by trade, and corresponded for a Scranton paper. His bravery is rather
               doubtful as in our battles he always got tired and lagged. He is the butt of
               his mess &amp; they torment him about his correspondence especially - and about
               sketching his various scenes - which is especially pointed because he was never
               present. Today, some of his men came into his tent and said, “Bachenheimer made
               one mistake in his sketch of the review and sword presentation. Bachy, as they
               call him, said nothing, but one of course asked What it was - Why he has
               sketched Gen Burnside with hair on his head. Gen Burnside is bald. We all have
               our hair cut very short, and some show very considerable baldness, as my own
               for instance, And the saying is, that one has his hair cut like Gen Burnside.
               George Arnold leader of our Band is full of fun. His imitation of the Irish is
               rich. He wears his mustache, about the size of a calfs tail, and makes a very
               odd appearance. He said he wore whiskers in Norristown. An old fellow then, who
               loved to get off a good theory on others but didn’t on himself met him one day,
               says he George - get shaved - why - oh you're a good looking man but youlook
               ridiculous you ought to have a clean face like me - come I’ll pay for a shave -
               well come along says George - And as they were going along George asked him why
               he disliked his whiskers - Why, says the old fellow, you look so much like as
               if you had swallowed a jackass, and left the tail stick out. Well, says George,
               do you know what your clean shaved face looks like, No, what? Why you look as
               if you had swallowed a tail and left the jackass stick out. The old man stopped
               - thought while - Well I’ll treat George.</p>
