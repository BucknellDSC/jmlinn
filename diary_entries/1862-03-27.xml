            <dateline>Thursday 27.</dateline>
            <p>Still suffering from my cold. Discovered the cause. I have been accustomed to
               wearing top boots &amp; heavy sky blue pants. Very foolishly on Saturday after
               our return I put on cloth pants, and shoes, &amp; have been wearing them since,
               though it has been considerably colder. Never thought of it, until this morning
               &amp; have reverted to my top boots again. This afternoon Beaver &amp; I took a
               stroll down to Ft Ellis [8 Dupre?]. This fort here is Ft Lane, five guns. The
               next below is fort Ellis of nine guns - built of sand shows a terrific
               explosion. The field all around is full of shell &amp; canister, scattered all
               around - pieces ofthe magazine hinges of the door - broken arches lying all
               around. Below this is Dixie. Its construction is peculiar. A heavy frame of
               logs, floored, covered and sided with planks - two rooms thus made for two
               rifled guns. Outside frames of [?] are made about the 
               <pb facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary52.jpg"/> size of
               barrels and filled with sand, connected by bundles of withes 20-30 feet long.
               These are built all around and over them making them bomb proof. We could see
               that the withes were tied with ropes taken from the sunken schooners - where they
               were cut off the sails. Below This are frames where they made these bundles.
               One of these guns was dismounted and spiked. There was preparation for building
               another of a similar kind near it. They named that saucy thing very properly
               Dixie. The next one below of 13 guns is called Ft Thompson. We got back in time
               for dress parade. We pulled for some moss that grows on the trees here. It was
               the first thing I noticed when I landed at Slocum creek. It is of grayish color
               and looks like the beard of an old man tied fast to limb. It has that
               peculiarity that it don't creep along the limb, but hangs in a bunch as if tied
               to it. We had an elegant supper of fritters, bread, omelette, ham, fried
               potatoes &amp;c. We move our camp up near Gen Reno's head quarters tomorrow. We
               have now two cases of varioloid in our company Hartz and Dougherty - Captain Taylor
               is down with it too.</p>
