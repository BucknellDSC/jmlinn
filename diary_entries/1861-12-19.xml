            <fw>Camp Union near Annapolis Md.</fw>
            <dateline>December 19th Thursday. 1861.</dateline>
            <p>Another bright, fine day. We had another grand review by Gen Foster today. We
               formed on the parade about ten o'clock. It was long tedeious and tiresome. Gov
               Hicks the Pres of the Senate and House on horseback - and some twenty or thirty
               indiscreet members who walked. They got very tired, and when they got to our
               regiment the 7th they hung their heads like tired dogs, &amp; never looked up at
               us - one old fat fellow puffed and blowed - We made a calculation - that they
               walked 24 times across the field the length of the Regiment, and twice across
               along it, making a distance in the aggregate of three miles. I was a little [?]
               and our men were very tired standing there so long, - and did their marching
               rather carelessly - then having to march in review once in quick time and once a
               double quick - we were tired too - What must have been the State of the
               Legislature. Lt. Col. Potter N.Y. 51st came and took dinner with us and spent the
               afternoon, as also Lt. Col. Bell. We had a very pleasant time. He told us that
               Sec. Seward was a very hard drinker - that is he was always sober before dinner
               but after dinner drank a great deal. He said he took him home from dining at Lord
               John Russells, in England, in his carriage very boozy. He uses tobacco excessively
               too. I noticed at Washington at his levee that I thought he drank a good deal, but
               afterwards thought it was only because he was a high [color?] The Lt.Col. gave us
               a very comic description of a negro sermon preached in Annapolis. Are not Abana
               and Pharpar rivers of Damascus &amp;c. I forgot the rest: but he went on to
               describe the leprosy - called it a noble disease - appeared to have some idea that
               it was a disease peculiar to noblemen. In giving a description of the scene at the
               house - He sent the servant in: the servant comes out. Massa is in de inner room
               and can't be seen - When he was in the river - he says he wallowed and dived and
               wallowed and dived - &amp; when he had dived a number of times - his servant
               called and dive again Massa &amp; he dived - When the prophet told him to go bathe
               in the Jordan seven times - then [?] bust out - Are not Abana &amp; Pharpar. The
               Lt Col was at our dress parade, but we did most miserably. Pride will have a [?]
               George &amp; Beaver have gone to town to [?] this evening.</p>
