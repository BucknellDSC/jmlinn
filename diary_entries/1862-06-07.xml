            <dateline>Thursday 7th.</dateline>
            <p>Yesterday it was raining, and about 10 o’clock I received an order to be at New
               Bern at 12 o’clock to sit on a board of survey of foreign stores. I got a
               dug-out of Grossonfer &amp; took two of my men to row, - the oars light &amp;
               the blocks broken off - waves running high, and wind blowing strong southwest -
               we had a hard time getting down half of the way, we ran to shore and poled. Lt
               Wright &amp; Goodridge 57 N.Y. were the other two. The latter was away North.
               We looked at the rotten hay &amp; oats and adjutants today. Lt. Morris was
               substituted. The schooner had been chartered by the gov. of Dibble at New York
               - he slipped in private stores, &amp; 40 bales of hay were left on deck. She
               sprung a leak off Hatteras &amp; was near sinking - both hay inside &amp;
               outside was damaged. We reported; however, that Dibble who had put the store in
               &amp; smuggled them into a port not open ought to be held liable at least for
               the 40 bales outside - for though they would have been damaged even if put in
               there, he ought to have put them inside &amp; it was a question whether by
               displacing the forage with other smuggled goods would not make him liable for
               the whole. He is such a mean old curse, he ought to be caught up. It rained
               this evening and I had to walk up. This morning as we were going down the
               guards of the H com. discharged their pieces, &amp; the minces with an angry
               [hing] came into the water all around us. Though we know what it was, it was a
               <pb facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary76.jpg"/>
               scared and mad party. Worse scared than in battle, &amp; we have then many a
               hearty imprecation. Dick was so scared he was going to jump into the Creek. We
               got a mail from the North with news of the battle of Hanover Court house and
               oak grove, &amp; evacuation of Corinth. Rec’d a letter from John of the 28th
               June.</p>
