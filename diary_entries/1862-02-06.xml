            <dateline>Thursday Feb 6 </dateline>
            <p>We moved farther up the Sound - very slowly - stopped about ten o'clock, and
               anchored about eleven. It began to rain became misty, and rained until evening,
               and then cleared off about six o'clock. When the anchor was let go, the boatswain
               gave a long whistle, and called down the hatchway "All hands splice the main
               brace" I watched &amp; wondered what that meant, but was soon edified on seeing
               the grog served out all around. The other evening a boatswain came on board and
               now everything is done by the whistle. The whole batch of reporters left this
               evening.They evidently got the idea that their advantages were not so great here
               for obtaining information. They were as jealous of each other as tom-cats, and
               every day or two raised a row with the Captain because he, or they supposed he
               showed favour to one more than the other, &amp; then they would have a convention
               - so that one wouldn't take advantage of the other. They were mad because they
               supposed the officers were corresponding for his dirty little country newspapers.
               Alcot, Ripley and Prawe asked the Capt. for a boat to go to the Spaulding - then
               all wanted to go. Capt. said but 3 could go at one time. When Alcot got over he
               sends a noteback to the Col. that it was with difficulty they were allowed to
               stay, and that they would have no sleeping accomodations. This was evidently to
               deter the Herald &amp; Inquirer. But as the Col. was not interested, he did not
               impart the information and they all departed. Burnside will curse the day they
               were allowed to come along, and the sooner they are sent off the better. We
               Pennsylvanians needn't expect anything from them - Even Alcot, not disposed toward
               us, seemed sort of mad because our Regiment was assigned the left of the Brigade.
               Roanoke Island is in sight of us - a little blue streak on the horizon. We can see
               a light house too. We can't tell what has been done today, further than that the
               troops of the Pioneer and Lancer have been put on other boats, and they, the
               boats, taken forward. They are gun boats and each have four guns. </p>
