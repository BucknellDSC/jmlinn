            <dateline>Monday 3.</dateline>
            <p>This morning bright and clear again. We had another trouble with our stove and
               had to clean [out?] the pipe. We have come to the conclusion that stoves were
               not made for this part of the country. One day seeming this pitch pine wood
               clogs up the pipe with soot and tar. Wide mouthed chimnies are the only
               comforts, and in them we will not dare to build the fires too high or we will
               set fire to the chimney. But if they are behind in many things, in building
               chimnies they have succeeded admirably. We noticed this particularly in the
               wooden ones put up in the wooden barracks, built by the Georgians. Beaver and I
               had started up to camp, when we were met with the Col. with orders to pack up
               and get up to the upper fort as quick as possible. We had nothing for
               transportation except a small hand cart. We hauled everything to the [narrow?]
               [path?] this side of Ft. Park, making a half dozen trips - carried them over to
               the fort, then carried dragged, and pulled all up along the beach, through the
               deep sand, up to the landing. It was a terrible job. It worried us very much.
               There we met the rest of the Regiment, &amp; our baggage put on a boat to be
               taken to the schooner, which was to take it to the Cossack. But the Schooner
               went off without it and the boat had no oars. The Dinkey came &amp; we piled
               the whole Regiment on it - our boat, which fortunately was in the same boat
               with the Surgeon's, which gave it a better chance was poled down &amp; put on
               the Dinkey. We got safely landed on the the Cossack about four o'clock. We had
               scarce been on here an hour when Mr Walton came on with a large mail for us. I
               received letters from John of the 19th &amp; 21st. In the latter he mentions
               the receipt of mine of the 11th, and the grand jubilee over the victory of Ft
               Donnelson. He enclosed a copy of the Times' correspondence describing the
               battle. It is grossly inaccurate, and as if written by one who had not been on
               the battlefield, but had picked up his intelligence from different mouths.
               Morris told me that Smith, the Times correspondent, was down there the other
               day with the [Gens?] &amp; some of the Staff, when the conversation ran on the
               coolness of some artist sketching Gen Foster in the midst of the fire. Smith
               said he was standing right by him. Frank Reno said you lie, you weren't there -
               no one was near him." Smith was in to our quarters the other day, and he got
               some yarns from me that made him gulp. We all now have separate messes on board
               the Cossack. We have been told that we are going to Winton and from there to
               Weldon. We have taken none but our well men along - being ordered to have none
               but those who can stand a march of 60 miles in two days. New rifles, Enfield,
               are on board for eight companies of our Regiment.</p>
