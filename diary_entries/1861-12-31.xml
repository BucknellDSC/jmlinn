            <dateline>Tuesday 31st.</dateline>
            <p>Still bright fine weather. We were mustered today. Nearly 700 men out or more
               perhaps - dressed in their best. We made a splendid appearance. They are drawn as
               in review, in open order - The rolls are called - each man comes to a support and
               as his name is called comes to a shoulder and then to an order. Every man must be
               accounted for whose name is on the rolls. We then had inspection and review - As
               we were marching in review Gen Reno &amp; staff, Lt Morris on his gallant bay. Lt
               Reno, &amp; Gen Park commander of the third brigade came in. They complimented our
               marching. Lt Reno told Beaver in town that company H marched finely, and were well
               drilled. Morris told us that they all said we did the finest drilling of any
               Regiment in the expedition, &amp; they had been around to all the camps today. We
               had Regimental drill during the afternoon. We think we are still improving. During
               the muster this morning - it was warm and pleasant. The parade ground is large
               &amp; level, and the slight frost melting made part of it greasy. The sun was
               bright and fine - the arms glistening in the sun, and a solemn stillness resting
               on the whole scene. Then came rushing across the field a big boar, his bristles
               sticking up, and after him two n____ and two dogs; the boar grunted, the dogs
               barked, &amp; the n____ made all sorts of noises. The hog, as usual with hogs,
               ran just the opposite way they wanted to drive him - indeed the plan of action,
               between the dogs the n____ and the hog, was so complicated, that it was
               impossible to tell which way they wanted to drive him - after a performance
               unequalled by any circus I have ever seen, they retired and the audience, the
               whole regiment was convulsed with laughter. 
               <pb facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary14.jpg"/> [?] I had my likeness taken
               today. This evening we had our school of sergeants and corporals. I could not help
               thinking how differently we would all have spent it if we were at home. The
               Zouaves rebelled today and would come out on muster. &amp; this camp was put in
               charge of two companies of the Connecticut Regiment. Thus endeth the year 1861. I
               cant remember how the last day of last year was spent, but I'm sure that I never
               dreamed of being in canvas walls, so far south as to have splendid weather. One of
               our men returned who had been to Union County on furlough. I now commenced on the
               other side of Baltimore &amp; in Union County there was sleighing. Here it about
               like the pleasant days of [October?] I will now close this up and start anew -
               &amp; send this home. Tom. Grier is not with us &amp; we feel like as if we were
               waiting for him all the time. </p>
