            <p>A bright pleasant day. We got a mail, small one, &amp; papers to the 25th. We
               heard through rebel sources that Banks was defeated &amp; 4000 prisoners taken.
               We see by the papers that Col. Kenly with the 1st Maryland was defeated, &amp;
               I judged that Banks was in a precarious condition. The Reg’t moved by
               companies, and 6 companies were moved, so that we stay here tonight yet. Adjt.
               Bible returned this evening. </p>

            <p>He looks well. He gives us glowing acct of the refutation of the 51st - He
               tells a good story on old Brower of Norristown who speaking of the sword Jones
               sent home, “Just to think I never thought there was much in him and he had to
               kill the men to take it.” &amp; some other one remarked that in after years he
               would regret having killed a fellow creature.” Rec’d a letter from John with
               the news that May Husburgh had eloped with Lineweaver. It is hard because some
               of the members of M H’s church at Lebanon are involved in it, and it will never
               be pleasant to remain there - It is an outrage because she is only 17 and he 35
               years old. Stolen to from our house. John is particularly indignant on that
               account. The minister who married them, they are determined to prosecute, &amp;
               wish for conspiracy. Tom Grier said that Gov. Stanley has commenced his reign
               by suppressing Colyers night schools, and the [d---] are in terror because It
               is reported that he said they would all be remanded to their masters. One said
               he would put a knife in his gut before he would go back to his Massa. This is
               all right. It takes all old Abes Wisdom to counteract the rascally radicalism
               of such men as Phelps and Hunter, who are, by the way, among the best Generals
               in the service. The 17 Mass returned from picket duty. I understand that the
               whole of the 1st Division are to be encamped here. </p>
