            <p><note>Linn gives the wrong day of the week for the continuation of June 12 and
                  June 13</note> This morning I went down to the 48th Penna, to take their affidavits on their
               claims for back pay. I walked down &amp; back - about 4 miles in all — I dined
               with the Major — but they never so much as said “Thank You.” They never asked
               me whether I charged fees, or anything about it — never expressed any regret
               for my long walk in the broiling sun — it sort of astounded me. Afterwards they

                treated me very cordially - but it was essentially dutch.
               Shorkley got quite indignant at it. While there I saw the first Locamotive come
               up from Beaufort, and cross over the new bridge. We all cheered it as it
               passed. At 3 o'clock we marched to the 51st Camp to Brigade drill. Ferrero is a
               fine drill officer. Gen Foster and staff, with Gen [Wauman] Adjt. Gen of Rhode
               Island - who comes, I hear, to present the sword voted to Gen. Burnside, by the
               Legislature of Rhode Island - and we had an impromptu review. In riding from
               the right to the front Gen Foster put his horse to his speed &amp; the little
               militia General was well put to - he looked as much scared as Gilpon &amp; his
               pants crawled up to his crotch - &amp; he had to get off to have them pulled
               down. It goes easy to drill by brigade but the awkwardness of it at first shows
               the necessity of men being drilled in masses. Gov. Stanley with Lt. Van Heusen
               rode into camp this evening just as we returned, adn appeared pleased with this
               quiet beauty. Last night Beaver and I staid up until one o'clock to see the
               Eclipse. We watched it until the moon was wholly eclipsed &amp; then retired.
               It is a hard matter to stay up late. It goes hard with me. Lt Beaver is officer
               of the guard, and has to be up this evening or tonight. Shorkley has gone to
               town to a meeting of Masons. I have made the beds &amp; spent the evening
               alone, as Dick has skedaddled too. The moon is full and our camp is lovely.
