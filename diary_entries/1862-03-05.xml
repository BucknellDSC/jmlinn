            <dateline>Wednesday 5.</dateline>
            <p>The day was pleasnt, the water rough, however. This afternoon we had a
               threatened storm that didn't amount to much but it was magnificent to behold.
               The sunset was very fine too. In the open space between a bank of clouds that
               rested on the shore and those that covered the sun there was the richest
               [tracery?] in scarlet and vermillion, and above in the dark mess of clouds one
               open spot golden hued. </p>

               <fw>Wednesday Mar. 5 continued</fw>
               <p>My company tried their rifles, shooting the rounds, at a [?] about
               200 yards off. They shot very accurately. The rocking of the boat prevented
               perfect accuracy of aim. I amused myself walking on deck, and writing
               a letter to the Chronicle. We despatched our letters this morning. We have
               such an abundance of fresh shad that we have got disgusted with it.
               Dr. Noble came on board and went to the Scout. Our surgeon is still sick
               in bed. He prescribes, however, and the [?] are experienced enough
               to get along. I hope he has received a lesson that he will not forget.</p>
               <p>I saw today the illustrations of the Bombardment of Ft. Barton in [?]
               Leslie adn New York Illus. news. The first is truthful but the latter is
               nothing at all like it except the ships, and those anyone can make.</p>
            <p>Our sutler got on board this day and has his goods. There is nothing to do
            here and much less to say about it. Each mess of officers have a table by themselves
            and the [styles?] are as various as the men. It is a much more comfortable
            way than the hotch potch we had before. We are no longer in danger of suffering
            for want of water, as we have a [?] was finished today, making 1400 gallons in
            24 hours. We usually consumed 700 gallons a day. We have just heard very 
            distrastrous new -- that Banks was defeated at Leesburg and 14,000 men taken prisoner.
            The news was brought her from the Pilot-boy. It is very improbable. He
            may however have crossed the Potomac, and they massed on him. It leaves us
            in horrible suspense until morning.</p>
