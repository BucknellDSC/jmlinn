            <p>This is a splendid day. It's pure adn bracing. The Sound nearly calm. Dr. Hassack
            turns up to-day to be sick with the varioloid. We sent two more men ashore today, Moseby [?]
            and Kause [?] That makes nine men we have in the hospital. We have another man taken
            with the symptoms, pain in the back &amp; limbs, &amp; may turn out of the same disease.
            We are still lying off Roanoke Island. The ships all appear to be in positions and loaded.
            with their freight. It looked lively and cheerful, &amp; we were in momentary expectation of
            orders to start. This is the day it is said that the draft men in North Carolina
            were to muster. There were two boats with troops went up the Sound, and it was 
            said they were going to Columbia, or the Albemarle, where one of the musters were
            to take place. I only hate this confinement on ship-board. It is breeding sickness
            fast. The Cap &amp; 1st Lieut of Co. I. were left on shore sick. Lt. [?] of Co. [?]
            has been sent from the Scout. The Adjt had a slight attack of hemmorhage of the 
            lungs today, and I heard it whispered that he was going to resign. The muster at [?]
            [?] is said to cover a loyal movement, and our expedition is said to be on hand for the [?]

            of aiding it. We had a fellow in one of our companies who shot a hole through his hand at
            Camp Union. He has been well cared for and required nursing day and night. When
            he could not bear the prssure of something or other the nurse held the artery. But 
            he is one of those who expects and demands all attention and shows not the slightest
            gratitude, but requires everything with a growl. The artery has frequently broken off
            and had to be retied -- in every instance almost owing to his ungovernable [?]. The 
            last time it broke was during one night that he wished to sit up, and he could 
            not sit unless propped and could not be propped without taking all the 
            blankets and coats of the nurses -- who were tired and wished to sleep &amp; refused, 
            and he broke into a fit of anger -- cursed &amp; swore -- and in the paroxysm the
            artery broke. It may require the loss of his arm to save his life.</p>
