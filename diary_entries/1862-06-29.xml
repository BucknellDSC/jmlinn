            <dateline>Sunday 29.th June. </dateline>
            <p>It was warm and we had a shower this evening. About noon the Col. sent for the
               Commanders of Companies and read our orders - to be ready at 8 hours notice to
               march. 60 rounds of cartridge &amp; 30,000 in the wagons - 3 days provisions in
               haversacks - 4 on wagons the latter only to be coffee, hard bread, and salt. To
               take none but those are capable of doing and rapid marching: tents to be left
               standing - guards to be of convalescents, who are to strike tents, and have
               them taken to town, to be put upon a schooner to be designated. This about the
               substance - only officers are not to be allowed any transportation. They may
               have one packhorse to regiment, but it is to be considered private property
               though allowed to go along in the train. 4 camp kettles &amp; 4 mess pans
               allowed to a company &amp; 3 wagons to a Regiment. This looks like a mysterious
               raid somewhere, and we have spent the day in various discussions - we know
               about as much about it as we always did - is probably a diversion in favor of
               McClellan. We had a sermon this evening by Mr. Mallory he standing before his
               tent and we seated on the grass. I noticed an unusually large attendance, which
               probably the prospects of a march effected. It put me in mind of Isaac Beck,
               one of my company, as he told the story himself, at the battle of Camden, in
               the midst of it, bullets raining all around, he pulled out his handkerchief to
               wipe the sweat off his face, &amp; jerked some cards out, which fell on the
               ground. He looked at them awhile and thought it would be a bad thing if he were
               shot, and was found with the cards in his jacket, &amp; he was going to throw
               them away - when the thoughts struck him he had just paid the Sutler 50 cts for
               them &amp; he thought he would risk it a while yet anyhow - so he picked up
               those that fell on the ground. He told it in a funny dutch way. I remember at
               Roanoke we were among the last regiments that moved up, and the road was
               scattered full of cards. Billy Allison remarked that we're getting
               conscientious - This was as we were going into the battle. I sort of hate this
               very rapid march, this hot weather - but as I have stood others pretty severe I
               know I can go through it. We were mustered as of tomorrow by the Col. Capt.
               Blair's company has been sent for - their baggage arrived this evening.</p>
