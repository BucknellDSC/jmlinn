            <dateline>Tuesday 11th</dateline>
            <p>It rained this morning, but cleared off, cool and bright. The fleet got under weigh about 
            nine o'clock, and under steam and sail, with the Scout, Smith, and another schooner in tow 
            about four o'clock, the Cossack anchored in Pamlico sound off Hatteras Inlet. The New York 
            got aground just as she was rounding the point from Croatan into Roanoke Sound, and 
            the Admiral off long shoal way. The Cossack was the first steam transport in to anchorage  
            the gunboats, the [?], Hussar and other gunboats that carried troopers were here before us.</p>
            
            <fw>Tuesday March 11th 1862 continued.</fw> <p>The day passed without incident. I
            spent most of the day reading Lossing‚Äôs pictorial field book, so far as it
            related to North Carolina. One cannot help thinking that if they [slaves?] the
            same spirit as they did in the days of the revolution it will be a difficult
            matter to conquer. But their cause is not just as it was then - North Carolina
            is not in heart as it was then. The men are as brave no doubt: but their enemy
            is not three thousand miles away. There is not [Chatham?] in the Federal
            Congress, or any portion of the people in the North that espouse their cause.
            Their social institution is false at bottom. Capt [Ricot?] remarked to us that
            there would not be such an universal resistance if it were not for the women.
            In the [Michdenburg?] District in the days of the revolution the young ladies
            formed an association agreeing not to receive the attentions of any young man
            who did not join the army in defense of their country's rights, [?] a man who
            would not fight for his country, would not be fit to be a protector of them.
            Perhaps the feeling arises from the stories of rapes &amp; robberies told of
            our army - perhaps because it is said we would arm their slave against them.
            They know well that their husbands and brothers make concubines of their slaves
            - that the slave if freed might wreak their vengeance on them. If I were a
            Southern women my fears, if I honestly believed this of the northern design,
            would drive me to a desperation. A tug boat came along side telling us she has
            a mail for us - The last we had was about the 21st &amp; 22nd of February. 17
            days ago. That was the last newspaper news we received. This will [bring?] a
            little later. We appear more anxious to receive this than any other - perhaps
            in prospect of a battle near - and it will be the last time many of us will
            hear from home.</p>
