            <dateline>Sunday 9th</dateline>
            <p>This was the finest day we have had yet, especially in contrast with the stormy preceding
            ones. The air deliciously pure, the sun bright &amp; warm, so that it was relaxing to be on 
            deck. We had company inspection and the doctor inspected us too. We had to send 
          Knode adn Adam [Hemy?] on shore, the former with the mumps and the latter with 
            symptoms, either of fever or small pox. They were both very reluctant. We spent 
            the day reading, loafing and smoking. Lt. Beaver went on shore to see the sick. All are 
            doing very well except Kelly, whose face is swollen so as not to be recognizable. 
            [NAME?] has turned out small pox too. The vessels that went up the Sound re-
            turned this evening. There is a vague report that they have 2000 prisoners but is very
            improbable. The different regiments appear to fear our Regiment worse than the 
            rebels. It is [?] that we have the small pox bad. We have everybody
            that has the least symptoms of sickness sent ashore, and I really believe that 
            [?] Lt Lynch is the only officer that had the varoioid. He is doing very 
            well. Buskin &amp; Cap. Perkin are sick, but not with that disease. 
            The Col. was telling us taht there has been a quiet fight going on to oust our 
            Regiment from the expedition. There was an effort of the kind at Annapolis.
            There Dr. Church ordered our Regiment into camp, but Gen. Reno evinced a 
            determination to the contrary, and stood by us. The wish to have the glory ex-
            clusively Eastern. But our officers kept their eyes open, and Gen Reno happily
            being a Pennsylvanian has stood by us. The impression appears to be that we 
            will sail tomorrow at nine o'clock, but as to which way there seems to be 
            a doubt. Morris says we are going to Newbern. But why all the vessels
            and troops were brought up from Hatteras to return. The same route seems 
            queer. However there is no telling where it will be. One thing we feel confident 
            about is that our generals what they are doing, and will certainly take 
            us safely through. I am anxious to get papers and letters to Reno. What 
            they are doing in the outside world. We are to take three schooners in 
            tow.</p>
