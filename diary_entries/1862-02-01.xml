            <dateline>Saturday February 1 1862.</dateline>
            <p>The name of that little scr. that came in was John Benjamin Washington. It is
               between 20 &amp; 30 feet long, and 8 or ten wide. The names of those on it were
               Trail Stubs, Peter Mc W. Davis, Thoms. Blay. Thomas Bulger, Lewis Longereau.
               Except Davis were all Northerners. They belonged to the Beaufort County Plow boys
               of the 7th Reg N.C. State Troops. Commanded by Maj. Hall, and were stationed at
               Middleton in Hyde Co, 25 miles S.W. from here. They were at roll call the previous
               evening, stole away along a creek got the schooner &amp; steered N.E. Bulger says
               he belong to 3rd Artillery U.S.S. in service 10 years was sent as a spy by Maj
               Anderson in April, but was caught in attempting to get back to Ft Sumpter sent to
               Stone Inlet, after 2 months escaped to N.C. Where he was impressed - rations corn
               bread &amp; pork - no tea or coffee - tea made from the[?] Tree whose leaves were
               worth $9 per bushel - rec'd no pay - gov N.C. issued a proclamation &amp; men were
               drafted, when he heard of the fleet that it was Maj. Hall made the reconaisance -
               came back ordered up two more companies - had them about 800 men &amp; he could
               whip 4000 yankees with them. Last night it rained and we had a very disagreeable
               time on board. The ship had not been policed for several days, ever since the
               companies from the Scout came on board. The rain drove them in from the decks,
               &amp; they were lying thick all over the boat - in the dirt and filth - every
               available foot was covered. Then to make things worse, the Surgeon, Capt Snyder,
               and several other officers having been off the boat and came back drunk, about one
               o'clock pulled the Reporter Bently out of bed, and they tramped all over the boat,
               through our cabin and among the men in the gangways. Capt Snyder very tight in the
               morning and the Surgeon evidently feeling stumpy &amp; [steaming?] it. The Scout
               came along side about ten o'clock and the four companies put on her &amp; she
               dropped astern. Shorkly came to me and told me that Santo who has been sick
               several days had the small-pox, evidently, judgeing from symptoms, though the
               surgeons said it was chicken pox. I felt dreadfully for a little while - no sense
               of personal fear, as I do not feel afraid of it, but I felt sick at heart to think
               that had broken out among us. Crowded as we were, and lying here unable to move
               him it could not but spread rapidly. The thought of our regiment being prostrated
               with it was horrible. I went to Dr Noble however, and he assured me that it was
               chicken pox - and that the reason why it was so hard on him was he was thick and
               dark skinned. We now dine at four o clock and have no supper. We relish our meals
               much more, as with three meals a day we had no time to get hungry. [Alcott?] told
               me that D'Epineuil raised his money by the sale of commissions - would kick up a
               fuss with some captain or other officer, kick him out and re-sell the commission.
               That Regiment has gone back to Fortress Monroe. The Lt Col Monteil is here some
               place. He had been ordered to rejoin his Regiment, &amp; after it was order- ed
               back he was directed to stay here. He is, I believe, an experienced artillery
               officer. It cleared of beautifully this evening, but the barometer indicated a
               blow, the Captain told me. </p>
