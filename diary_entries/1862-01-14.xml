            <dateline>Tuesday January 14.</dateline>
            <p>It blowed fearfully and those outside the bar last night must have had a severely
               rolling time last night. The little Picket, used by Burnside as his ship, is owned
               by her Captain, named Ives, who is a wealthy man, and offered his services and
               boat to the Government without pay and received a captain's commission. The
               [Steamship at?] New York is fast on the bar. The surf is so bad that the tugs
               can't get near it. And the captain won't allow a boat to go ashore. The Officers
               Mess is out of provisions. We have no meat &amp; came down to the last scrapings
               this morning. There is a little fellow, nominally a servant of Capt Blair, as
               peculiar as Blair too, goes by the name of Bucktail. He is about 15 years old,
               with small turned up features, wears a belt with a bayonet &amp; scabbard, large
               blouse and large pants. He is from Tyrone Father &amp; Mother dead, all from
               Tyrone - got into camp at Harrisburg, in the employ of some of the serjts - &amp;
               one night about ten o'clock came up to Blairs tent, saying that they had turned
               him out. He started with ten cents - [?] newspapers &amp;c - Blair [?] him five
               dollars at Camp Union: because with his little capital he had to go to town so
               often to replenish - He has paid that back - &amp; has now some ten or 15 dollars.
               The other day he got [?] sea sick and some one told him to take a dose of salts.
               He came in and wanted Blair to get him a dose, &amp; could hardly be persuaded to
               the contrary. I think his name of Bucktail came from his having some kind of an
               animals tail inned on to his hat. The wind has blown stormily all day. A little
               gun boat dragged her anchor and has come against us twice. We have just heard this
               evening that the Scout with other sailing vessels have come in. The steamship City
               of New York is still aground - they cut away her mast, and her smokepipe came down
               this afternoon. Of all desolate looking places this beach is the most desolate.
               Those that hold her must have a very disagreeable time. We are getting down to the
               originals in our officers mess. We have no soft bread. At noon we had pea soup and
               hard bread, and the adjutant fished up a little bunch of butter out of his [have?]
               sack and gave us a knife full. This evening we had hard bread, cooked rice and
               tea.</p>

            <fw>Tuesday January 14. Hatteras Inlet</fw>
            <p>I remember of hearing Mother often remark that rice was such a tasteless thing
               when cooked without milk. This was evidently cooked with water. We had no butter.
               The hard bread is good - the tea is good the rice seasoned with salt, and sugar to
               make it gritty was good. I don't know what we are to have tomorrow. I see
               Commisary Shorkley in anxious consultation with the Quartermaster. We have seen
               the ships lying outside all day - but I hear that most of them have got in. We
               conjecture that the first attack will be on Roanoke Island. The surf ran so high
               that the Captain would not allow his boats to go ashore, so that we have not had
               any communication with any one.</p>
