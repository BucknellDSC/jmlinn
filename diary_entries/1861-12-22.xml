            <fw>Camp Union near Annapolis Md.</fw>
            <dateline>December 22 Sunday 22. 1861.</dateline>
            <p>Another fine day, though cold. Had company inspection at ten oclock. Then we had
               orders to form our companies without arms and accoutrements &amp; march to the
               parade ground, where we had a sermon by the Rev Mallory, our chaplain, "I am the
               way and the life" After dinner Beaver, Tom Grier and I went to town. We went by
               the wagon road to take a view of the camps though we commenced the adornment with
               ever greenes and have the advantage of the situation the yankees have taken up the
               idea and have gone ahead of us. The 10th Connecticut have archs wreaths &amp;c.
               The arch over the main street has an eagle with oustpread wings worked in pine.
               The N. York 31st have an arch in which 1776 worked in pine as also flags, and
               other devices. We went down to the warf and saw the river covered with vessels
               some one told us there were twenty four transports. some are large side wheel
               steamers - I noticed the New Hampshire New York . Most of the others are painted
               black. I suppose they would not afford as fair a mark for artillary as the white
               ones. As we came back up the railroad I noticed we saw a train bringing in the 7th
               Rhode Island Battery. The preparations are so great that it is supposed that it
               will be ten days before we will be able to start. Beaver staid in to attend
               church. Tom and I went into the yard of the Episcopal church where there are
               several old tombstones - rectangular tombs of white marble. By itself at the
               corner of the church is one [?] to the memory of Margaret Carroll, relict of
               Charles Carroll, daughter of Matthew Tilghman, born January 15, 1742, died March
               14, 1818. Over by the side of the church, was that of Rebecca wife of Daniel
               Pulaney, daughter of Col. Walter Smith died March 18. 1737. aged 47 years.
               Enclosed in an iron railing were those of William Bladen died August 9. 1718.
               Benjamin Tasker Jun. late Secretary of Maryland died October 17. 1760 aged 39.
               Honourable Benjamin Tasker died 18. June 1768 aged 78, "which , tho of a
               constitution naturally weak and tender he attained through the efficiency of an
               exemplary temperance. At the time of his death he was President of the council a
               station he occupied 32 years. The offices of the agent and Receiver General &amp;
               Judge of the prerogative court he successfully exercised." I observed the other
               day the chickens roosting on the branches of a low tree over the latter tomb, and
               Tom scraped away the piles of excrement in order to decipher the inscription. It
               has begun to rain this evening about nine o'clock. </p>
