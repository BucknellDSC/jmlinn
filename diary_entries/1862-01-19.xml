            <dateline>Sunday Jan 19.</dateline>
            <p>It was very foggy during the forenoon - we were up early, had breakfast, and the
               two ferry boats, Patuxent, Pond Curlew came alongside. We all got out, with arms
               and equipments - our company getting on to the Patuxent. They were both fast to
               the Cossack, and worked and pushed and crashed each others sides at a desperate
               rate for a half hour. We began to fear that it would not move. While we were
               watching it listlessly, both boats fell back &amp; raised together, and lifted the
               Cossack right off - We held our breath awhile to be sure it was moving - we saw
               all the other ships must be moving or else our long-hoped release had come - she
               moved sure, and we gave three hearty cheers. A little regardless perhaps in the
               delirium of moving again, the stem of the Patuxent struck a hole in our stern; it
               was crowded with men - one was knocked off his feet and jumped into the light boat
               - another pitched after him - The extent of the damage, however, was in [trawing?]
               back of a musket, and breaking off the front teeth of one of our men Hugh McClure,
               but it was a very narrow escape. We dropped astern and then hauled up to a
               schooner &amp; lashed fast. We watched them unloading the horses from the Peabody.
               It was anchored about 57 yards from shore - the horses pushed off the ship
               tumbling down 4 of 5 feet until they reached the water, &amp; men in a boat lead
               them by a rope to shore - It seemed a cruel way of doing it, but was accomplished
               safely. They were trotted around on shore, until there was no danger of chill. The
               Capt of the Patuxent is named Bennet, a short red faced man. The three Ferry Boats
               Curlew, Pilot-boy were chartered at Philadelphia by the Government to go to Port
               Royal and put in here on account of [?] of weather, &amp; Burnside put them in to
               service. He used to run the Keystone state. He said he had been on this coast 16
               years, and never knew such a week of such weather as last week. About 11 o'clock
               we got back to our home in the Cossack. Our Captain Burnside, Reno &amp; the Pilot
               were sounding the channel across the swash this afternoon. I spent the afternoon
               reading. Some men from the Pocahontas came in the evening. They were wrecked about
               15 miles above Hatteras light-house. Their boiler gave out during the storm,
               anchored and dragged on shore - out of 120 horses save 17 - All the men were
               saved. The Pilot told me this evening that it is 52 miles to Roanoke Island - that
               any vessel that can cross teh swash would go up the Sound - but the rebels had
               taken up all the light Boats and buoys. The name swash is probably a contraction
               of sea-wash. We are anchored just inside the inlet, but before we can get into the
               sound there is the swash - a shoal of sand yet to cross. We have a sea-shell
               mania. Parties go out to the shore and collect shells - some are very beautiful -
               some are lucky dogs and find nice ones. Others come in with a batch of very common
               looking shells. They will be probably carried far <pb facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary26.jpg"/>
               <fw>Sunday January 19, 1862</fw> or lost long before they get home - but they
               serve to fill the hour - the tedious monotonous hours. I find I have injured my
               eyes reading in this dark cabin - I long to get back to my canvass home. We had a
               New York Tribune today which states that the [John Trucks?] which had the Zouaves
               on board, put back to Fortress Monroe.</p>
