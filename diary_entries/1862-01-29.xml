            <head>Wednesday Jan. 29. 1862</head>
            <p>This was a delicious day. One felt like lying out on the sunny side of the deck
               &amp; enjoying the [?] - the air was so pure - but they told me the barometer was
               sinking, &amp; I have pains in my bones this evening. I was out on deck until ten
               o'clock just lazily enjoying myself. Then I looked over [Lossings?] pictorial
               history of the U.S. I think that is a most admirable book. About twelve a
               suspicious sail was in sight and a gun boat started in pursuit. We watched them as
               they sped away, until both faded from sight and the reach of our glasses. The gun
               boat returned toward sunset, but I have not learned the result. I only saw that
               she had nothing in tow. A coal schooner came along side, and they commenced
               putting on coal. The Pawtuxent came up with the four companies from the Scout, and
               crowded them on our boat. I understand that the Scout is to be brought across in
               the morning - she and the Rue - which has our camp equipage on board and to be
               taken in tow by our ship. I was on board the coal schooner - one of the [?] told
               me that along the Southern shore there are a great many dead bodies [in bodies?]
               washed out: lying along the Beach. Supposed to be those that were killed when
               Hateras was taken, buried at low tide and since washed out. He said he had heard
               that there were 240 killed. About sunset the Spaulding came across the swash - [?]
               every ship load - the band of the 24th Mass playing hail to the chief, and Dixie.
               We gave her a cheer as she let go her anchor among us. This was the ship that ran
               regular trips between Fortress Monroe, Hateras, Port Royal. She is a very fine
               steamer. Gen Burnside took her, made her his headquarters, substituted another
               steamer, I think the Eastern State. It was said that when she came across the
               swash, the expedition would sail. I got a "World" of the 22nd from the Sutters
               Schooner. There were some conjectures about our Expedition. Roanoke, Washington
               and New berne were mentioned as points of attack, and that 50,000 men had probably
               been sent from the army of the Potomac to strengthen these points. Clearly North
               Carolina will be the theatre of war very soon. To take Roanoke, occupy New bern,
               and hold it as a point at [?] to make way for an army to to go goldsoro - The army
               of the Potomac must then retrograde &amp; when that is done their cause is done.
               Tom Grier and Harry House came on board this afternoon: both looking fat and
               hearty. They were both very sea-sick - Tom, as expected, made friends with every
               one, and has a button from each State Regiment sewed on his overcoat.</p>
