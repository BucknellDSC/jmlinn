            <head>Sunday Jan. 26.</head>
            <p>This was such a bright bracing day - We had the long swell of the water, remaining
               effect of the late storm - The waves danced gaily in the bright sunshine - the
               wild geese and ducks sailed about in droves and the sea gulls gathered like snow
               flakes over the dark green water. In the fresh morning breeze came the Admiral
               over the sea - wash - Two of [Ward's?] 62 [?] [?] were brought from the wreck of
               teh gun boat Zouave and put on the [fore-part?] of our boat. After dinner, Mr
               [Glott?], Rodamel, Shorkley &amp; I got into the first cutter and sailed over to
               the [Sutlers?] Schooner - the air was fresh enough to be bracing - the water rough
               enough to give a bounding, exhilerating motion to the boat. We went down along the
               channel, among the vessels so familiar to us, past the wrecked Zouave, under the
               bow of the Scout - I thought I had made her out among the vessels over in the
               sound - out into the farthest pockets, <pb facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary29.jpg"/>
               <fw>Sunday Jan 26. continued</fw> as the deep places of the harbor are called -
               the harbor is full of schoals and deep places - the deeps places are called
               pockets - It was near sunset when we left the Sutlers boat - we saw the Northerner
               gaily steaming into the sound, cheered, as she passed, by those already there. It
               really makes one feel good to see the difficulties at last overcome - there are
               now 12 or 13 transports across - but the sun sank, as we [?] under a light wind,
               back - leaving a horizon of orange and gold - gloriously resplendent. We got back
               to the Cossack in time for tea - refreshed very considerably by our trip. There is
               a brother of the [shoals?] gets the night-mare, almost every night, yells horribly
               and wakens up every one in the saloon. Markley remarked quietly that he wished he
               would ride that mare in the [daytime?] We coal tomorrow - I read a paper this
               evening - the Baltimore American of Jan 23. It says "all that has been heard from
               the Burnside expedition was a despatch from [?] Goldsboro that the town was full
               of people flying from Newbern: also something taken from one of the Southern
               papers - that one hundred of Burnside's fleet were seen on Pamlico sound - that
               probably they would attack simultaneously Roanoke Island and Newbern - that they
               were prepared for them in both places I think there are some thirty ships,
               transports and gun boats now in the sound the balance are out in the inlet yet.
               But we saw schooners come scudding in all sails set - [jibsail] - [staysail] -
               [foresail] - [mainsail] - [main topsail] - fore-topsail] - I learned their names
               from Mitchel the sailor who steered our boat -</p>
