            <head>Wednesday January 8.</head>
            <p>There is a square rigged brig lying out near us, which was captured on New Year's
               day endeavouring to run the blockade off the mouth of James River. I just learned
               the distinciton in ships. A schooner is a boat with 2 masts without yards. A
               square rigged brig has two masts and yards. A hermaphrodite brig has two masts,
               one with yards. A ship has three masts witih yards. A bark three masts, two with
               yards. We learn this morning that the men in the boat last night, run over by the
               wheel[?] steamer, were all saved &amp; doing well. They were of the 27th Mass.
               Those supposed to be lost were on shore &amp; returned to the boat this morning.
               First serj [very?] hurt, on recommendation of the surgeon, need a furlough for
               sixty days, and has resigned his serjantry. This vessel is the former Eastern
               duty, now named the Cossack. She is 237 feet long and 30 feet [beam?].</p>
            <p>It is really a beauiful sight on deck. There are some forty ships and steamers.
               The day is bright - the wind blowing brisk, waters sparkling in the sunlight. The
               Scout is just now 3 o'clock P.M. towed up - containing the balance of our
               Regiment. It is said we will start at four o'clock. The steamers have [this?]
               steam up. The first brigade is distinguished by a red flag. The second by a blue
               flag. The latter is ours with no 2 on it. The Scout is numbered [8?]. Everything
               looks brisk and lively. We have been hourly in expectation of moving. As it was
               growing dark, a boat came around our bow - I was walking on deck - Lt Morris voice
               sung out - "Cossack" "Aye Aye" I yelled. "Col Hartranft on board" "Yes sir" "Call
               himm out". And the message was that the Captain should keep a good look out for
               three rockets - Then the first gun would be a signal for the first brigade to
               move: Two guns for the second. We have drill in the [manual?] on deck during the
               day. I received a letter from Annie and one from John. George rec'd his pistol and
               shoes from Philadelphia. He told me that there was a long crowd around the Express
               office, &amp; happening to catch the Agents eye, he gave him the Freemason sign,
               and was waited on immediately. Otherwise he might have waited all the day. We
               spent most of the afternoon on deck, looking at the gay scene. My marine glass is
               a very useful [auxilliary?] in our pleasures, and we are as much pleased with it
               as any children with their toys. One of the notable characters among our Officers
               is Lt Blair. He is the man that things dress parade a humbug, and his own careless
               unofficer appearance indicates his tastes - the size of his shirt collar is a
               wonderful and straight out - pointed - like his black eyes - like his nose, like
               his disposition - sharp, pointed, cutting. He is extreme in all his views -
               expresses everything in a sharp way. He always turns up in any discussion; he
               dislikes adjutant, and hammers him unmercifully. The Adjt is slow at repartee.
               Blair has been Lt of the Guard today and his oddities and eccentricities have
               appeared in a very prominent manner. He has demonstrated on Lloyds map that our
               ship the Cossack is to land at [Apalachicola?] and go up and take possession of
               the Railroad at [Talahasse?] - Lt Col Bell is to [stand?] at Cedar Keys - Florida
               - [with?] the "Scout" and hold the road there - &amp; then the United States
               holding [Formadina?] - then we had possession of Florida. Our steam is up &amp; we
               will probably be off tonight.</p>
