            <p>Clear. I went with Mr Carpenter, the mate down to the Picket, to inquire for
               the mail, but found she had been only to Hatteras, &amp; brought none. Then we
               went to Gen Burnsides Head quarters on shore to inquire for coal - then up to
               Ft Reno to see our Quarter master about provisions &amp; went up to camp to see
               our sick - they were in our old quarters but they had with chicken pox - two
               others we have in the hospital. When we came down to the beach a party had a
               little [bull?], like a two year old, but which a grey headed darky declared had
               been on the Island 6 years, &amp; he was old then, hitched in a high cart,
               filled with boxes and barrels. He walked off with [is?] [mountain?] load with
               considerable care. We sent Bobst to shore, sick with the chicken pox. Shorkley
               &amp; the Captain went over to Croatan island to the fortification that the
               rebels blew up, on the day of the surrender. It was made by putting in two
               canal boats end to end, and filling up outside with sod. A man said they had
               about a thousand darkies. He said also that they had drafted on in three on the
               Island &amp; this was the day they were to come after them. We got some sweet
               potatoes and a bottle of milk. The sick are getting worse. The rebels had run a
               gun boat through which we had put some holes into the shore at Croatan Island,
               and there it sank. Our gun boats took away all the cannon burned the boats, adn
               took up the engine &amp; boiler of the gun boat which were in good
               condition.</p>
