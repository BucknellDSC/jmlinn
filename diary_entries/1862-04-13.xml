            <dateline>Sunday 13. </dateline>
            <p>On Thursday morning I went with Lt Morris on board the [Vidette?] with 3
               companies of the New York 51st to go up the Trent to Pollocksville. Everything
               seemed against the expedition. I felt badly, and as if I had no business to go
               along, though I had the Gen. &amp; Lt Cols' permission. Took breakfast with
               Morris and went down to the river. The Ocean Wave took us to the Vidette - The
               New Yorkers were mysterious [?] they were on a serious expedition. I suppose
               their reporter was along - I know Mr Schell was along - &amp; when we ran
               through the draw of the bridge and knocked one half of it down, he made a fine
               sketch of it. We had no surgeon - I went to Gen Reno - he sent me to Dr Cutter
               - he to the Surgeon of the 2nd Maryland, but as they were across the river, we
               concluded not to go after him, as we had a Dr from Pollockville 
               <pb facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary58.jpg"/> on
               board, when [Baron?] Egglestein of N.Y. 3rd had taken up, whilst visiting a
               patient, with another man named [Baras?] a merchant up there, bound hand &amp;
               foot &amp; sent him down as a spy. We ran aground a mile up above the bridge
               &amp; put them ashore to foot their way up. We lay all night then came down,
               got two tugs and pulled her off. So ended the Expedition. Saturday I was
               officer of the day. While standing out by the road, a horse came along with a
               coffin, followed by a buggy with a little boy. It was going out of town.
               Another buggy came in with two ladies, and when they saw the hearse, they set
               up the most piercing screams - they beckoned to me to aid them in getting a
               pass to follow the body out. They were the mother &amp; aunt of the boy 16
               years old, who had come to town &amp; died suddenly of congestion of brain. I
               suppose he was a rebel soldier, but I did not press inquiry. Today I went with
               Tom Grier down over the battle ground. We took pleasure in having out the big
               [pine?] trees. We found a ram-rod whose end had been bent by a bullet, and near
               it a bullet that fitted the indentation on the rod - evidently the same bullet
               that hit it. The trees showed wild shooting on both sides. The horses had been
               buried in the trench &amp; a very disagreeable odor prevailed. We heard the
               news that a battle had been fought at Corinth and after two days hard fighting,
               the rebels defeated, Gen Albert Sidney Johnston killed, &amp; Beauregard an arm
               taken off. The loss on both sides great. This battle I feared most of all. It
               is the last struggle for the Mississippi valley.</p>
