            <p>We went over to hold Court, adn had just been seated when we got the order to
               prepare for review. We adjourned and I got back just as the Regiment was moving
               off. The review was by Gen Burnside at last. The New York

               December 20 Friday continued 1861</fw> 57th came in just in time on double
               quick. Burnside is a fine, sharp dark eyed looking man, and rode a beautiful
               horse. He has black hair whiskers along the side of the face. The review passed
               finely in the same order as the other days I spent the afternoon in looking of
               McClellans bayonet exercise. This evening Gib and I went to town, called at Dr
               Claude, to see Miss Burton, but she was not at home. Going along the street we met
               a miserable looking white [man?], worse with whiskey, who was asking a negro wench
               to go home with. "I don't want company" "I can see myself home." We went into the
               National Hotel but recently opened. I remembered the last time I was in here, sick
               and weak and miserable, I enjoyed the hospitality of Mr Monroe and his pretty
               little wife. Last Spring - I had been officer of the guard all night - attack
               witih diarrahea - He took me there - put me in the nicest whitest bed so it seemed
               to me - I had not seen a bed for [three?] weeks - and told me to sleep until 2
               o'clock when they dined - I had been in bed but an hour when he came and wakened
               me, saying that he was sorry to disturb me, but that orders to march had reached
               the Regiment. I had been sent for. I jumped and with a [larity?], at which he
               seemed surprised - &amp; with a cup of tea I bid them good bye - my last look was
               at his pretty wife. I got a glimpse of them as the Regiment marched past. He has
               gone to Frederick where he has a female seminary in successful operation. He moved
               about two weeks before we came here.</p>
