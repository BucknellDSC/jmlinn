            <dateline>Thursday 20.</dateline>
            <p>This was a delightful day - like ours of May. I went ashore with Captain
               Bennet. The prisoners were getting sick by the dozens, and the surgeons said
               they would die in piles if we remained long. It smells dreadfully down there,
               &amp; the filth &amp; dirt is indescribable. Although we have plenty of flour,
               there is no means of baking - our hard bread was done, &amp; from the trouble
               in getting [food?] seemed as it was, I was afraid of a row, if the want of
               bread was added to the trouble. So we went up to Reno's quarters, and I gave
               him the history - He said we would start this afternoon which was good news -
               so when we got to the beach we saw the flag at half mast, blue, &amp; knew it
               to be recall of all hands to the ship. I had fortified myself however with an
               order to remove all my sick to the Peabody. We got to the Cossack in time for
               dinner, twelve o'clock anchor hewed immediately and we ran up to where the
               other vessels were anchored, just above the head of the Island, and along side
               the Peabody. I communicated my orders, but just then Gens Burnside &amp; Reno
               came up in [Ship?] Price, and orders were given to sail, so we concluded to
               leave them on board. The day was bright and we went it gaily, the little tug
               Champion leading the way, next the Spaulding, Peabody, Admiral, Cassock, New
               York. The Spaulding was the officers and the Peabody the wounded and sick.
               About four o'clock we entered Pasquotonk river. The shores were marshy and
               lined with dark pines, with here and there an acre or two cleared, and a
               windmill. At one place six windmills were congregated and ten were in sight, so
               we neared Elizabeth City. There were plantations and some fine looking houses.
               The most beautiful sight were successive [?] or steppes of dark green pines, of
               different heights, thick and dark - as if they had been cleared and grown at
               different pines. The water was dark colored like tan bark, the shores winding,
               bluffed with groves of the tall yellow pine. We rounded a point and came in
               sight of the place, a shire, tall brick buildings, like mills, apparently just
               placed on shore among the tall pines. On the point was their fortification
               tenantless, &amp; gunless, its magazine blown up, and near the shore wrecks of
               gun boats, one a propeller perhaps the [Jamy?], and one a side wheeler. The
               shore appeared close in here. The sunset was very beautiful - and the scene was
               sombre enough - those pines give it a dark severe look - perhaps in the summer
               it is brighter - but the most pleasant sensation was to see something of
               civilization again - a town however small. As we came near, &amp; I saw the
               houses &amp; farms on shore - Large fine looking houses, some with balconies
               all around - in the calm evening much like our summer, I thought more of home,
               and how I would live &amp; alter things in our old house, than I have done
               since I left home. I was talking to one of the Surgeons - he said though he had
               been very enthusiastic for southern rights, he thought if he got off he wouldnt
               get in the army again.</p>
