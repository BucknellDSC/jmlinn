            <dateline>Friday January 10 1862.</dateline>
            <p>The boat stopped last night about eleven o'clock on account of the density of the
               fog. This morning the fog was still very thick, could not see fifty paces ahead.
               About nine o'clock there were signs of clearing &amp; the Captain ordered the
               engines to get up steam. We are still thirty miles from Hampton Roads. Some time
               after we started. We had dinner at half past 12 o'clock, and we went on deck. Soon
               we saw the masts of vessels looming through the fog. Then the red light boat, the
               [Kipowaps] Sewells point and fortress Monroe There were three men of war - the
               sailors manned the yards and cheered. We cheered in return. We soon recognized
               some of our acquaintances. The New York, New Brunswick. We dipped our flag as we
               came in. We anchored off the fortress toward Sewall's point. The [?] are a heap of
               rocks out to the left of us, with some stone walls, 2 stone houses, and some poles
               with ropes tretched. I saw but on cannon perched up pointing toward Sewalls point.
               It looked an acre or so in extent, and is exactly like the summit of Mount
               Washington. Willoughby point was [?] on the red light boat. The day cleared, but
               it was still smoky - we looked with interest upon the places we had so often read
               about. We were all soon in the cabin preparing our letters to send home. I wrote
               one to Aunt Margery, one to the Chronicle and one to Annie. We went up after
               supper, but saw nothing but a gunboat out towards Sewalls point, used as a
               watch-boat. Lt Col Bell came on board and took tea with us. It was so foggy that
               we could see nothing until we entered Hampton Roads. Sewalls Point is a long low
               reach of sand, covered with woods. I could see a house and barn a mile perhaps
               from the point. We could not distinguish anything at all on the point, except that
               the sand appeared who reached up along the edge of the wood, but that may have
               been done by the action of the waves. The fleet here is not so imposing in
               appearance, as up at Annapolis - perhaps because the harbor is wider. Hassenflug,
               and John Smith, the Col's servant were the only ones that were sea-sick. Teh
               adjutant has a great time with his consolidated reports, and each Captain has to
               make one every time, to rectify mistakes &amp;c. It is the great bore of all of us
               and especially the adjutant. Blair remarked that he expected that the adjutant,
               when he died, would take the form of a consolidated report.</p>
