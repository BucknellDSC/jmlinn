            <dateline>Friday 30.</dateline>
            <p>The day was very warm. We took down our tents &amp; packed, “waiting for the
               wagon” when about 9 o’clock the wagon master came, and told us he had orders
               from Quarter master Hall not to haul any more over the road until it was
               repaired, and that he would furnish transportation to the river, and on the
               other side of the river. If my tents hadn’t been down I wouldn’t have budged -
               we asked "what then - is there a boat”, well his instructions didn’t go any
               further. Some peoples was mad, and an indefinite amount of hard swearing done.
               We expected this from Hall, but yet we couldn’t restrain our indignation. Our
               Quartermaster starts off with the wagon-master to see about a boat. Directly
               the teams came, &amp; we of course thought there was a boat - loaded up -
               Beaver went with the teams - I started with the company by the road. It must be
               5 miles - we crossed the Trent by the Bridge, part of which we knocked down
               when we went through the draw with the Vidette, and up the left Bank of the
               Trent. Within a mile or perhaps less, a deep creek 
               <pb facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary73.jpg"/> joins the Trent, then
               runs along it up, with perhaps 500 yards of land between, covered with grass
               like Timothy, then makes a bend like a horseshoe &amp; comes back again –
               across the neck it is but a few hundred yards, but the peninsula contains
               several hundred acres – on the peninsula is our camp: covered with grass &amp;
               shaded with pines - the banks covered with luxuriant foliage of pines and trees
               &amp; flowers </p>

            <p>The stately cypress, made venerable by the gray-beards of Spanish moss – The
               creek is very deep. Oh it is a lovely place. But we waited long and wearily.
               The others have their tents pitched, and our prospect seemed to be to roost on
               the trees or spread on the grass. Just at dusk and we saw a big <pb/> flat come
               floating up. Polled with long poles – we had a great time unloading – everybody
               cross – sharpers looking out for boards - men quarreling over their piles – for
               boards are considered the luxuries of the camp. The tents were hastily pitched
               in the dark, &amp; we all took a good sleep. </p>
