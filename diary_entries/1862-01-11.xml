            <dateline>Sunday 11.</dateline>
            <p>This was a bright fine day. A lot of us got into a surf boat and went o shore. We
               first went to the Fortress. It is immense and the number of cannon surprised us. I
               think it is a mile and a half around the ramparts, and enclosese 80 acres. In the
               inside are houses for officers and quarters, and trees - live oak. The 10th N.
               York Vols or National Zouaves are quartered in it. Their uniform light blue, with
               [pink Solfine trimming?] We saw the Union Gun down on the beach, 12 inch bore, and
               the Floyd lying beside it, not mounted. There are an immense number of guns, many
               of them ten inch, lying outside. 150 at least are mounted. Grass is grown over the
               piles of ball inside. From one side we saw Camp Hamilton, and the ruins of
               Hamilton - nothing but the stacks of chimnies standing up, like ghosts. We went to
               a store - a little store but got everything you asked for. I got some drawing
               paper. The grocery also furnished everything wanted at very advanced prices
               however. Capt. Cook, formerly of the old Fourth met us on the beach and came pver
               amd tppl dinner with us. I amused myself trying to sketch the [?] - but the vessel
               kept swinging around and I was so slow that I did not succeed &amp; wound up my
               labors sketching a hermaphrodite brig lying near us. As the Adjt. came in Blair
               says "There comes consolidated report." "Consolidated Bible" says Mallory. "Bound
               in calf" says Blair. The "Scout" and the Brig that we towed sailed somewhere this
               afternoon. Part of the fleet is gone. We have [to?] coal - 25 tons &amp; take in
               water yet - 100 tons of coal last six days. Do we go up the Potomac? Up the James
               River?We have our bay Pilot on board yet. Captain says he won't know but his pilot
               will be changed. 1/2 past nine o'clock. P.M. Lt. Reno just came in, and gave
               orders to get upstream and start. It may be interesting, hereafter, to note our
               conjectures. Rodamel asserts that we will not go out of James River. Bently, the
               reporter, says we are going to Lynhaven Bay - behind Norfolk. Beaver asserts that
               we go to Savannah. The Col. said that we go to [Lece?]</p>

            <fw>Saturday January 11.</fw>
            <p>Ten o'clock P.M. anchor heaved and we start. The water in the roads smooth as
               glass but it heaves now that we are out in the bay. The Col, rec'd sealed orders,
               merely told us that we were going to sea. Blair gets the [?] but can't [fish?] it
               yet. The Col. says he will tell us our destination in the morning. The commissary
               says that there are no better [?] than we have. The chief engineer has been on
               this boat 8 years, [?] in the stormy coast between Portland and St. Johns that she
               was thoroughly overhauled at New York before coming to Annapolis - so that so far
               as good steamanship, good enginners and a staunch boat can carry us we will go
               safely. 12 o'clock, our bay pilot takes leave of us at the light ship, and we
               steam out into the [?]</p>
