            <dateline>Saturday May 10 1862. </dateline>
            <p>This was another lovely day. The weather has been so delightful for the last
               week, that one does not feel like doing more than he can help - but let life
               float. We stuck all our tents to air them dry on the ground. We had our tents
               condemned the other day, and received Sibley tents this afternoon, but not in
               time to put them up. This forenoon Lt Beaver and I went to see our sick this
               forenoon. Smith is recovering slowly, &amp; I think Bensinger &amp; [Fike] are
               too. They are in the Regimental Hospital. Down at the Academy are Knode in the
               lower ward, Santo, Snyder &amp; Harding in the upper, Knode told us he was so
               glad we had come to see them. I told him I had been down but couldn’t find him.
               I told him I had seen Harding the other day “Why wasn’t Harding killed where
               they attacked us here?” “No,” I said. “Well he lay here just as if he were
               dead” He evidently was not yet able to separate the real from the dream, and
               who knows how many fierce and bloody battles he had fought in his deliriousness
               and how much he suffered in them. Harding, was flushed, but sensible, though
               the Doctor told us not to talk to him much. My former friend, who mistook
               thunder for artillery was very talkative, &amp; The Dr would not allow us to
               talk to him. The “Gaston House” is painted out and “Union House” painted In.
               Stetson of the Astor House is to keep it. As we passed there Capt Neil
               recognized, his clerk as one who had been clerk or treasurer of some New York
               club &amp; found dishonest. He said he would rob him. This afternoon, Charles
               Mallory and I went across toward the Neuse. Between this &amp; there is a half
               Moon and Star fort in process of erection, nearly completed. I suppose we will
               move north west in a week or ten days. This evening we were ordered to send all
               our sick down to the hospital who would not be able to march in four or five
               days. I should think the fortifications will be completed in that time. </p>
