            <p>Another delightful day. Our Regiment was on guard yesterday and we were up last
               night. I got a tub last night took a bath one of the Islanders had washed some
               clothes for us - and now I feel a new man. Beaver and I went over to see the
               site of Ft Raleigh. The [?] of a mound, but grown over with trees fifty or a
               hundred years old, are to be seen. it is in an overgrown thicket. [Jim?] a
               darky piloted us to it - He was ship launcher - that is helped to get off ships
               that were beached - He said the rebels told him that we would put him in [?]
               and take him to [?] and sell him. We passed the house of old [Dol?] - two
               rebels in uniform were brought up to see the old man before he died. Yesterday
               one of the barracks in which the rebel prisoners were, was taken for a
               hospital, &amp; the prisoners were turned out, &amp; had to lay out all night.
               It was a pity, but we were as bad for we have our men crowded in two small
               rooms. This evening an order came that each captain should take five prisoners
               into their quarters. It was an utter impossibility with me. Beaver &amp; I
               talked with them last night a good deal. They are very ignorant - &amp; are
               something like our rivermen without their smartness. We got our mail last
               night. Rec‚Äôd three letters from John &amp; one from Annie. Our boys were
               sitting around reading newspapers &amp; the rebels stared at them. They look
               agape at us drilling. This afternoon Lt Col Bell took the regiment out along
               the beach. Saw an ancient mill, where there were still remains of corn lately
               ground. This with being on guard duty last night makes me undisposed to
               write.</p>
