            <dateline>Monday 10 </dateline>
            <p>It commenced snowing, and on the whole was a very disagreeable day. This after
               noon or evening I started to go on board the Cossack, I went with Lt Blair, Brown
               &amp; Conolly seamen, &amp; a half dozen others. It rained and grew dark on us
               before our weary tramp of five or six miles through the sand ended at the Pig
               point battery. As the cook pointed out where our boat lay, visions of hot coffee
               and warm biscuit rose before me - decent coffee we had not since we left the
               Cossack - &amp; that was nothing like Dick can make. Our vexation can be imagined
               faintly when we found the boat gone - we were five miles from our camp and it
               would take two hours to make it - it was snowing. We made various attempts to get
               over - we started to get quarters. Our clothes were wet we had no blankets - We
               found a little house whose whole front had been knocked out with a shell - built a
               fire with about a half cord of wood at a time and got just inside the house. Oh,
               but it was miserable It was the longest night I had yet spent, of all the
               miserable nights I had spent since I left the Cossack. About eleven o’clock we
               were roused with the news brought there, to the headquarters, we were not aware
               they were in a shanty close by that the gunboats had run past the fortification at
               Elizabeth City, slap against the gunboats boarded them set fire to &amp; burned
               five, the Jamy among the number, captured one, then turned their attention the
               fort, landed, spiked the guns, blew up the fortifications. The rebels set fire to
               the City, blew up the locks. The mayor of the City came off and surrendered to
               Capt Rowan, and requested him to assist in putting out the fire. Rowan said that
               he could not consent to land &amp; if they saw fit to fire the City he could not
               help it - that he could not lie under the imputation of having fired it. </p>
