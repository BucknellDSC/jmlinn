            <dateline>Friday January 17. 1862.</dateline>
            <p>We raised anchor to go beyond the swash or bulkhead - a sand-bar just beyond the
               inlet before you get into the Sound - but in getting down, we ran foul of the
               chain of the anchor of the Rocket - Then we did not move for fear it would take
               off our rudder. Then Haskell, - a man who was once in the common council of New
               York - no credit, says Capt Bennet, except that he got their enmity by being
               honest - he rendered signal service to the fleet at Port Royal, and on
               recommendation of Foster was appointed to have superintendence over the fleet -
               came over in the Phoenix, a bloack eyed, black mustachioed man, quick as a rat -
               he said everything appeared to be unlucky - None of the propellers but one could
               pass the swash; except steam tugs were to come, &amp; not one here - can't lighten
               the ships nothing to do it with &amp; the Phoenix was sinking. A little boat came
               along - "Mail on board [?]" Boat lowered and [Col cot] scuds away returning very
               soon, holding up a bundle of letters as he hoves in sight. There was none for me
               however, or Beaver or Shorkly. Dr Gibson and Curtin got on board the Phoneix -
               don't know how the mean to manage their escape from Hatteras. The Col &amp;
               Chaplain &amp; party returned this morning. Wind and tide kept them. The Chaplain
               staid at Ft Hatteras with Capt Morris. Col &amp; Dr went up to Camp Winfield,
               where the 48th is. Col went the rounds with Maj. Nagle. Most important they got
               butter ham beef tongue and other things of the [?], which arrived in time - We had
               Skoush thats the way its pronounced, a sort of pork pot pie - only crackers
               instead of dough, and [?] for dinner. The unusual luxury of butter made its
               appearance- so we had ham and beef tongue for tea. The "Scout" arrived to day at
               last. They were blown out into the gulf stream, carried down as far as Pt. Lookout
               - hadn't seen the sun for three days - were short of water - limited to a pint a
               day - though we had given them up - and by this time the battle had been fought.
               Every thing appears to [we expatiously] unlucky. We had a bad loss in the wreck of
               the "City of New York" - a schooner and gun boat sunk. To night it is raining like
               blazes - I expect before morning the wind will get up again, and some other craft
               get foul of us. The Louis [?] is evidently in a dangerous condition. While we were
               foul of the Rocket, some other steamer got aground in the channel of the swash so
               we are kept here. We were aground half the time to-day. Well I suppose that we
               will get out tomorrow. I only hope that tomorrow will be a sun-shiny day so that
               we can get the decks &amp; hold cleaned. I am getting very anxious about that. We
               can't keep it clean somehow. I finished reading The Mill on the Floss. I'm getting
               used to storms, and look on wrecks with indifference. This is an abominable place.
               I never expect to have such comfortable quarters as I have now, but the hold and
               decks are a constant source of anxiety to me. Body lice, and infection of worse
               diseases may be well [?] But it was decided again that we wouldn't move tonight.
               So the Captain got to work to get his boat of himself. We got every man we could
               out - crowded them on the bow - then double quicked aft - then from side to side,
               but budge she wouldn't.</p>
