            <dateline>Monday 17th</dateline>
            <p>It rained furiously all morning. But quit toward noon. We were put in charge of
               the prisoners in our camp somewhere near five hundred, and ordered to get ready
               to go on board the Cossack as guard. About noon, the regiment formed to escort
               them down, but the Adjt had neglected to give us orders, and in the stress of
               time we had to get ready. Beaver was left to bring down the baggage - he got an
               old go-cart, but we marched off without him. We were all put on board the
               Dinkie, and taken to the Cossack - where we stowed them in the hold and between
               decks - Many were sick and very miserable - we put them in the ladies saloon -
               Little Connolly that spent the [snowy?] night with us is down with the
               smallpox. I was talking to some of the prisoners - one of them asked me with a
               seriousness that made me laugh, whether our government had not sold many of the
               slaves taken from their masters &amp; that escaped to the Spaniards - that they
               had been so informed - also they had been told that on our march up to [?] that
               we had burned pillaged and destroyed - raped women - that many men had to stand
               by and see their wives and daughters raped before their eyes. They asked me
               whether they would not be allowed to go home before they would have to go into
               service again, and said they would like to get out of it. We feel that we are
               in rather disagreeable service, with the number of dirty filthy, sick men with
               all sorts of diseases, mumps, fever, chicken pox &amp;c - but have said that we
               are to do our duty, and leave the consequences in the hands in whom all things
               are. We took possession of one of the bridal chambers. Mr Mallory, Charles
               Mallory &amp; Capt Snyder are on board, &amp; we form a mess. Beaver &amp;
               party got on board, in a surf boat with all our baggage last night which puts
               us in good trim. I little thought when I sailed on the Cossack that I would
               ever have charge of her.</p>
