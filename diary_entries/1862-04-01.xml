            <dateline>Tuesday April 1. 1862.</dateline>
            <p>The day was hot, the sun making it so - but the air would at times feel chilly.
               I was quite unwell during the forenoon, weakened down by my cold and diarhaea.
               After dinner owing to some startling rumors I was induced to [?] over to New
               Berne. The [?] was as still as death, but the quiet work going on amazing.
               Artillery was being hauled out back of town: the 57th N.Y. &amp; 11th Conn.
               sent to work on the fort. Our pickets had been attack last night one killed -
               one rebel killed &amp; a deserter came in, who gave the information, that 5000
               rebels were five miles this side of Kingston, and 25,000 in Kingston advancing
               this way, under command of Gen. Ransom, an old West Pointer, well known to our
               Generals, and said to be a man of considerable dash. 
               <pb facs="https://leaf.bucknell.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/diary54.jpg"/>
               <fw>April 1 continued.</fw> The [?] [?] was sent to Hatteras last night at
               twelve o'clock to hasten the reinforcements. The Admiral came in while I was
               over there, &amp; we saw the Cossack go up afterwards I met Fitzpatrick, cor.
               of Herald, who gave me papers with the news of the Battle of Winchester. He
               said the 17. Mass. 103. N York, &amp; 2 Maryland were there - &amp; some
               batteries in all 3000. [Parke's?] Brigade with the companies New Jersey are at
               F Macon, so that we have of our old force, 25. 23. 27. 24. Mass 10th 11th Conn,
               51st N.Y. 57. Penna. 21 Mass, &amp; 4 companies 9th New Jersey, 6 of the 48th
               Penna, about 6000 effective men, &amp; the reinforcements 3000, 9000 in all. It
               is wonderful how reduced the regiments are by sickness and death. Our regiment
               for instance, had but 450 men on dress parade - &amp; say [200?] guard &amp;
               other details makes us a little over 500 strong. I have nineteen sick in my own
               company. But prospects of a battle would call the sick out. It appeared to be a
               matter of anxiety to Gen Burnside that the troops were broken down so, and he
               attributed it partly to want of fresh beef &amp; vegetables &amp; he said that
               he had written to Washington urging beef to be sent. If the rebels wouldnt come
               for a week, they couldnt come past that fort. Col. Bell says his orders are
               that if he hears heavy firing to form and march to the Ferry. Lt Bell that was
               with Capt. McRae in the battle with the Texans and New Mexico was his
               brother.</p>
