            <head>Monday 20.</head>
            <p>This is a bright lovely morning - the first one we have had - it is like a summer
               day. We were loaded on to the Patuxent again, swung away from the Cossack. She ran
               up turned around, came down on the rate of 20 miles an hour, ploughed through the
               first bar, stopped, swung around aground again, Gen Reno was on the Patuxent, and
               as he saw the Cossack go through, fairly danced. But feelings slightly changed
               when she got [hard?] fast again. We went up to help the Scout out &amp; with the
               help of the Pilot boy pulled her in to safer anchorage. Then we devilled around to
               [?] Captain Bennet of the Patuxent's expression, and were put on board the Cossack
               about half past twelve, in time for dinner. Bennet says he never saw such a tide -
               when its high tide its low water, low tide high water - he'd be devilled if it
               wasn't. Many of those on the Scout we had not seen since we embarked, and it was
               comical to hear the mutual greetings of the men. So here we lie, high &amp; dry
               again. With how much truth I cannot say, but Morris says it was the intention of
               the Expedition to go to Yorktown. It is supposed that we will be embarked on
               schooners and taken up to Roanoke Island. It is very dreary and monotonous staying
               here, though this getting out and cruising around makes one feel better. I only
               fear sickness breaking out among our men. Necessarily the ship is getting very
               filthy. Half the ships are aground again, though this morning there a good many of
               them afloat. Lt. Col. Potter &amp; Maj. Legendre of the N.Y. 51st came on to see
               us this evening. We are still hard aground. I was up and with the Captain well it
               appears that the man divorced from a former wife on account of some improper
               conduct, and married a second time. This was made in favor of the second wife in
               order to prevent any difficulty that might arise, if the legality of the divorce
               was called in question. </p>
