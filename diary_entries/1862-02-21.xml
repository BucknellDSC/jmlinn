            <dateline>Friday 21</dateline>
            <p>It was bright &amp; fine this morning. The Spaulding &amp; Peabody were taken
               up first to unload - The New York and then the Cossack. There is twelve feet of
               water at the wharf and several fine brick warehouses, market houses and other
               fine buildings. We could see up one of the streets, which was narrow lined and
               arched with trees, &amp; in the summer time must be very pretty. The different
               companies were called off, one at a time, and names called &amp; checked. We
               met some of the officers Capt Picot Col Jordan &amp; others. Their tone was
               changed, since they got on their sail out of reach of us - false fawning, in
               order to get well treated, apparently grateful - The 3rd Georgia Reg't was on
               duty &amp; I understood from one of their Lts, that they were on duty along the
               canal, &amp; some bitter con- versation between them and our men ensued, until
               I ordered mine on board. The officers lie to their men without doubt. Capt.
               Picot said to his men as soon as he saw them "Boys I have good news for you -
               we have licked them on the Cumberland and taken 5000 prisoners. That 3rd
               Georgia Regt needs a dressing [bad?]. We all parted with bitterer feelings -
               the much more so that the ungrateful dogs gave us such an ill return for all
               the trouble &amp; exertion we made to make them comfortable. In the forenoon
               while waiting for our turn I went with the Capt. on shore on to the ruins of
               the Propeller [Jamy?]. &amp; where they had the battery - four guns lay there,
               but their carriages burned &amp; their effectiveness destroyed. About four
               under sail and steam ran down the sound, &amp; anchored at Roanoke Island about
               seven o'clock. It was piercing cold this evening. The officers on the Spaulding
               growled at their [fare?] but the Capt told them that they got better than they
               deserved.

               <fw>Friday 21.</fw> In the ruined battery were buried two men Fred. [Herman?],
               seamn &amp; Thos O'Mara Co A. Rhode Island Vols, who fell Feb. [10?], 1862 for
               his beloved country, as it was inscribed on their head boards. The 3rd Georgian
               Reg. wore our blue overcoats, and they have been captured in the [?].</p>
