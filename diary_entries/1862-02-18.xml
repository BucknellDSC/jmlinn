            <dateline>Tuesday 18th</dateline>
            <p>Our men were busy cleaning their arms and we put up racks amid ships. The
               [light?] &amp; Capt Snyder went ashore. Kelly came back with him - having
               absent two days without leave I put him under arrest. Two surgeons, rebels were
               sent on board to attend to the sick. Of all miserable dirty squalid looking
               men, these prisoners are the worst - We turned them out on deck and counted
               them numbering 484. This evening we cleaned out the ladies cabin and made a
               hospital of it. [?] &amp; mumps appear to be most prevalent. This evening the
               Dinky came along side with 50 or 60 wounded prisoners There was a rebel doctor,
               a very gentlemanly fellow, with them and he protested against putting them on
               board. I felt disinclined as we had enough to do. So the capt of the Dinky,
               Chambers, concluded not to put them on. The day was cold. A fleet with soldiers
               came up the channel - some said the D'Epineuil Zouves were along. I never wish
               to be put in charge of a prisonership. Though some are very intelligent the
               majority are helpless as they are ignorant. They all tell us that we have
               treated them very kindly. War is horrible. I first saw the pomp &amp;
               circumstance - the battle field - the dead and wounded now the prison ship. I
               felt relieved when they took away the wounded - we had no bed pans - and they
               would have to evacuate as they lay - I could imagine what it would be by
               morning, from what I have already seen. I understand we are to go to Elizabeth
               City. My hope &amp; wish is to get there soon. Tom Grier came on board to see
               us this evening. He looks very well.</p>
