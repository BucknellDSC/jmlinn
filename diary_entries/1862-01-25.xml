            <dateline>Saturday Jan 25</dateline>
            <p>The day was clear and cool - the waves ran high. We are beginning to recognize old
               comrades now across the swash. I saw the eagle beak of the Scout with my glass.
               The Northerner and Admiral are lying together not our the the bar. We were
               watching some firing from the Hunchback. The burst of flame and smoke long before
               we heard the report - then the rushing noise - the explosion of the shell - a
               cloud like a mans hand - in the air 3 or 4 miles from the ship - [again?] long
               before the explosion heard. If one gun makes so much noise what will many make. I
               was officer of the guard yesterday - the [Lts?] did not work well - &amp; was up
               all night - &amp; felt delapidated most of the day - the brightness of the sun -
               the rolling glittering waves &amp; sharp northern air made it unpleasant to be out
               - it blinded me - Reading so much in this dark saloon has affected my eyes
               somewhat. Last evening we had some warm bread, and this evening again - which
               though tough was sweet, and delicious with some butter that [Rodarmel?] [raked?]
               up somewhere &amp; I paid 50 cents a pound for it. The bodies of those two men
               that died were lifted and taken up to the burying ground up at camp Winfield. I
               should have gone up there, but have neglected until now it is too late. Getting
               over and back has been no easy matter during the last three or four days - Some of
               our boats had to be brought back by the steam tugs. We got into a fine discussion
               as to card playing &amp; chess &amp; checkers - some contending that there was
               chance in checkers as in eucher. - one that cards was chance which resulted in
               some one producing a chess-board &amp; checkers - &amp; Shorkly Adjutant &amp;
               Chaplain have indulged. Last night while going the rounds I found a card party in
               every rat hole in the ship. They appeared to have runners out, so as to give
               notice of my coming. It would sound like the scampering of rats when you go into a
               cellar with a light, just getting glimpses of their retreating forms. One place in
               the forecastle I wculd just see them going down a hole into the hold, and past
               going round a bale of hay. I drafted instructions and regulations, and I suppose
               everything will be back to the old state by the time my turn comes, &amp; I'll
               have to take renewed curing, for getting up something new again.</p>
