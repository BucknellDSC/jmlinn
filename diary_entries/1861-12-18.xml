            <dateline>December 18 Wednesday 18. 1861</dateline>
            <p>Still fine weather. We went over to the Court of Inquiry, we adjourned from the
               House to the Col's headquarters. His tent is nicely fitted up. Has a writing desk
               like the one in my reading room. We examined witnesses for defence. The butler got
               us up a dinner of steaks - there were large and we incontinently each ate one.
               Rice and bread constituted the other parts of the feats. The Col has a frame of
               wood put up around inside the wall tent, &amp; in stead of tent pole has two
               forked stakes put up - this prevents the wind from affecting the tent. We sat
               until late at night. Col Martin spoke of the man that was shot for desertion at
               Washington - that the bullets did not go through him, though the detail that fired
               were but 6 paces from him. Col. Maggi explained it by saying that the bullets of
               rifles acquired their penetrating force only by passing through the air a certain
               distance - the wind - and they do not yet require that at six paces. Col Maggi
               &amp; Col Monteil said that they never went through a campaign in which they did
               not lose their baggage - when different divisions marched on the same line - got
               mixed, crossed each other, and the baggage one lost never reached their
               destination. I can easily see how it would be, from what little I know. A division
               or even a brigade hardly ever knew what regiments composed another - especially
               one division never knew what Regiments composed another &amp; baggage may be
               easily lost. I remember the night we went to Centreville, several divisions came
               up and crossed each other. Our division got in between the baggage train of the
               N.Y. [Fire?] Zouaves and their regiment - and their baggage train got in between
               mine. I had charge of Gen Franklin's brigade train, and our division, &amp; I had
               some trouble to find our brigade. Tom Grier and I started to walk to town: the
               21st Mass is relieved of their charge of the railroad by the 11th Pennsylvania.
               The guards of the latter were all drunk and unfit for duty - no wonder with the
               example set by Col. Dick Coulter We went into [Dunkers?] for oysters: the Editor
               Baily &amp; Dr Jackson 11th Penna - were talking and drinking - Baily giving the
               Doctor an account of all the ills he suffered since he was a boy - especially that
               he had bad lungs &amp; a cough and never was free from it until he was afflicted
               with a fistula during the last [?]. The Legislature was in session - they were
               just starting a vote on the resolution - Many of the members protested against the
               6th some the 4th but voted aye for the sake of the message of the resolution. We
               returned about twelve o'clock finding Dick Coulters men drunker than ever.</p>
