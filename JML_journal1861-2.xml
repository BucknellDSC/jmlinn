                  <date>November Friday 22, 1861</date></head>
               <p>This is a bright fine day. We got up about seven, breakfast, Company drill,
                  dinner, Regimental drill, Dress parade, supper brought us quickly through to
                  evening. I went over to see our sick - Jerry Miller, Fogleman &amp; Kelly in the
                  Hospital. I sent them tea and toast. They looked wretched and the hospital
                  arrangements are far from comfortable. Beside them lay Charly Trainer, weakened
                  down with a severe hemorrage, &amp; not long for this world. He was with our
                  Company in the three months service &amp; was lately in Hassenplug's. He has been
                  discharged the service. I went out in to town to inquire for Mr Monroe, but since
                  he has moved away to take charge of a school at Frederick. His Brother Harry has
                  now charge of the seminary. Col Hartranft's lady was here this evening. The Col.
                  returned from Washington today.</p>

               <p>This morning when we got up it was raining and the camp was wet and dreary. I felt
                  as if I was glad it rained to get relieved. But it cleared off about ten o'clock.
                  There was regimental drill but as our muskets were freshly marked, I got excused,
                  but we were out for dress parade &amp; had a march in review. We had the pleasure
                  of welcoming Seth [House?] back this afternoon, and this evening Beaver returned,
                  bring in all that we expected of him, Geo. Shorkley is lieutenant of the guard
                  today. We had an oyster pie for dinner, but we were hurried &amp; didn't enjoy
                  it.</p>

               <p>The day was gloomy - sadly overcast - air windy &amp; this evening it commenced
                  snowing. We had preaching by our Chaplain. "Rebellion is as the sin of witch
                  craft." the text. This afternoon Shorkleley Beaver &amp; I took a stroll through
                  the navy yard, town &amp; cemetery. Every thing has an air of decay. </p>
               <p>The navy yard does not look like it did when I first saw it last spring. The old
                  Battery looks natural enough. So the Cemetery. There are the graves of the
                  Randalls, [?] &amp; many old familiar names. As we came out of the cemetery we met
                  an officer with a [squad?] of men from the cavalry Regiment going to dig a grave

               <p>This evening Tom Grier and I went to Presbyterian Church &amp; came home through
                  rain and snow. We saw several handsome ladies, one in particular. I got vaccinated
                  yesterday, &amp; this evening it itches considerable I have two slight scars on my
                  arm, but they are very slight.</p>

               <p>We moved our camp from St. John's College to about a mile &amp; a half from
                  Annapolis. We are now comfortably fixed with the only disadvantage of a scarcity
                  of water - a very serious one by the way. Jeremiah Miller, one of our company died
                  last night - about eleven o'clock of hemorage of the lungs. We had hardly expected
                  it, though we were about getting his discharge. We had a grave dug in the soldiers
                  burying ground near Annapolis. Our removal to-day prevented any discouraging
                  effect, which might have been were it not for the excitement caused by it. We are
                  brigaded as [?] in the Second brigade of the Coast Division. The day was bright
                  and fine though somewhat cold. One of the tents caught fire &amp; burned up a
                  while ago. We have given one of our wall-tents to the servants, &amp; have taken a
                  common tent for our kitchen &amp; Dick's quarters. We have a sheet iron cook stove
                  &amp; one also for our tent which makes it cosy and comfortable. I was officer of
                  the day yesterday. We received news of the death of Will Cameron last Friday.</p>

               <p>We buried Jerry Miller to-day with the honors fo War. Shorkly &amp; I went to the
                  Legislature - they were swearing in the Speaker &amp; Members of the House. Did
                  not get out in time for Regimental drill.</p>

               <p>A bright fine day again. Nothing was done in camp but policing. The boys brought
                  evergreens, dug trenches &amp; now we have a most beautiful camp. I received a
                  letter of introduction to Gov. Hicks from Gov. Curtin.</p>

               <p>This evening I called, was agreeably rec'd &amp; introduced to his daughter. He is

            <div>
               <head>Sunday 8</head>
               <p>We had company inspection, had the Col, Lt. Col, Chaplain &amp; his brother to
                  dinner. We had to buy an extra white plate yesterday. Dick [?] up a white table
                  cloth - turkey &amp; cranberry sauce, beefsteak tomatoes, pickles, pound cake
                  &amp; apples graced our board. Col. Bill asked for water, &amp; Dick went out
                  &amp; recruited a half dozen big tins &amp; that with the tin pitcher made him
                  look like a tin pedler.</p>

               <head>Tuesday 10th</head>
               <p>Yesterday I was officer of the day &amp; took occasion by the leisure it afforded
                  me to fix up pay rolls &amp;c. Last night I made the grand rounds, &amp; the
                  greenness of the sentinels was amusing. One fellow stuttered &amp; when the sergt
                  told him to say if the countersign is correct Advance grand rounds, he commenced
                  with [The e - -?] it - it - oh shit - in his vexation he exclaimed. Today was very
                  fine as to weather. We went out target firing for the first time this morning.
                  Koser &amp; Neyhart made the best shots - This evening Jeremiah Miller's brother
                  came here. John Morris was acting adjutant at dress parade and did it well. The
                  south wind is blowing &amp; we will be apt to have rain soon. We have enjoyed a
                  week of glorious weather. John Morris took tea with, but we had to borrow a candle
                  from him to eat it by. Tom Grier says his balls weren't big enough, they went just
                  the target.</p>

               <head>Wednesday 11.</head>
               <p>The morning was dark and lowering, &amp; the forenoon passed with wind and rain.
                  This afternoon cleared brightly, &amp; though somewhat windy, it was beautiful I
                  was notified that I was appointed Judge Advocate in a Court of Inquiry demanded by
                  Lt Col Vignier de Monteil of the New York 53rd commonly known as the D'Epineuil
                  Zoaves, on charges proffered against him by his Colonel D'Epineuil &amp; Cap W.W.
                  Armstrong of the same Regt. The charges are unofficer-like conduct, getting drunk
                  &amp; speaking disrespectfully of Col D'Epineuil - among the rest that he
                  D'Epineuil had never seen service - never anything but a common sailor - also that
                  he ate breakfast at the same table with his orderly. This Regiment dresses the
                  same as the French imperial Zouaves - blue jacket trimmed with yellow, blue scarf
                  around the waist, skyblue pants - bagging down to the knees - Tom Grier asked <pb

                  the other day whether he couldnt carry ten days rations int he seat of his
                  pantaloons - white leggings. Tom took the notices of the Court of Inquiry over to
                  D'Epineul - he saw his wife, a buxom french woman dressed in the full Zouave
                  costume. </p>
               <p>We have a little black pup belonging to some one in the Regiment. He is called
                  General, and is very playful. During the solemnity of the Dress parade, he got
                  after the heels of Lt. Morris, acting adjutant - then he treed the Colonel, and
                  wound up with biting the heels of the Band, when they were beating off. The butler
                  arrived this evening &amp; began by distributing a piece of tobacco to the boys.
                  There was a grand rush - for they were nearly starved for it. It has caused great
                  rejoicing, as they think it an end to their troubles, &amp; especially as they
                  were notified at dress parade that the paymaster would be along soon. Beaver went
                  to town - to attend meeting I suppose.</p>

               <head>Thursday 12</head>
               <p>This was a bright fine day though cold. I put on my full uniform and went to the
                  Navy Yard, and attended the Court of Inquiry. The Col Lionel Robert d'Epineuil,
                  Lt. Col. [Esq?] Vigeur de' Monteil witnessed. Lt. Col. Maggi, Captain Cipriani
                  Captain [blank] Major [Caritan?], Capt. [Willard?] Lt. [?], Capt. W.W. Armstrong -
                  Board LtCols Bell, 51st Penn, Lt.Col. Potter 37st N.Y. &amp; Lt. Col. Martin 11th
                  Penn. Maggi was counsel for Lt. Col. Monteil. He is an Italian. We had an
                  interpreter Lt. Col. Legendre. We sat until near three o'clock and adjourned. I
                  came out in time for dress-parade. Col D'Epineuil invited me to tea. I went over
                  to Mr Welsh, where he has his quarters, &amp; spent the pleasentest kind of an
                  evening. The major is a jolly fat man: the [Abbe?], Capt Cipriani Capt [Grifian?]
                  We had music. The Col sang - Capt Cipriani &amp; the Cl's wife - a french woman,
                  who says her mother was English. They all speak English very well. I find what Tom
                  told us abotu the Col's wife wearing Zouave uniform was a hoax - though I
                  suspected it when I told it. I kept it up when I came home giving a full
                  description of her. It was an eminently social evening. The lady sent for a little
                  box - french particolored fancy box - and it was batted around - it had various
                  colored confectionary - [?] eggs = lozenges: the Maj Cantel was a short clumsy man
                  with a bald head and rat tail mustachios. He put me in mind of [the Maj?] in Capt
                  [C Matley?].</p>

               <head>Camp Union, Near Annapolis December 13 Friday. 1861.</head>
               <p>This was a bright fine day, clear but cold. I went to the Court of Inquiry. The
                  examination of Capt. Gilmore was concluded - then a sergt was examined and winding
                  up with Maj. Cantel. Maggi was very impertinent &amp; thought himself very cute.
                  Maj. Legendre was calm &amp; passive. Maj. Cantel with his dumpy figure and
                  rat-tail mustache got excited when Maggi asked him whether he considered himself
                  competent to judge of the capacity of the Lt.Col. When we adjourned the french and
                  Italian had a vigorous onslaught of words. They stood up to each other in the
                  position of a soldier, &amp; blathered away, it was quite amusing. I got out in
                  time to see the Division reviewed by Ge Foster - 8th Connecticut, 51st New York,
                  51st Pennsylvania, 53rd New York. D'Epineuil Zoauves. The Connecticut were a
                  [spiraling?] looking [sett?] - about 500 - New York were another fine looking
                  [sett?] But the 57th Pennsylvania was the finest of all - better looking men,
                  finer marching and the only Regiment that went through the review in proper form.
                  The D'Epineuil Zoauves looked well - but they had a comical looking Drum Major,
                  with an immense bear skin hat, &amp; a band that sounds like a dutch organ, &amp;
                  a drum corps which was simply ridiculous. Our regiment passed in fine style &amp;
                  passed once in review at double quick. The flat at the place where the Reviewing
                  Officer stood was once carried by the 4th Connecticut at Bulls run, by Capt
                  Fowler's Company, now in the 8th Connecticut. It has several bullet holes through
                  it. An officer told me that it disappeared during the fight, &amp; they afterwards
                  found that the carrier had skulked and hid it in the fence corner. There were
                  several ladies on the field - one particularly handsome. It is quite a treat to
                  see ladies. Our camp looked very beautiful from the field of review. Tomorrow the
                  Division is to be reviewed by Gen Burnside, consisting of the two brigades 10th
                  Connecticut 22nd 23rd 27th Mass in the first Brigade. The twenty fourth Mass
                  arrived at the Navy Yard this morning in the steamer Admiral.</p>

                  Foster, Burnside no having arrived. The day was splendid, &amp; there were eleven

               <p>Another fine day, thought somewhat cold and windy. I was at the Court of Inquiry.
                  Adjourned at two. I went into the House of Delegates. Heard two speeches on some
                  resolutions with regard to the partition of Maryland Delaware and Virginia.
                  Cameron was fiercely denounced - and there was a secession speech denouncing
                  Cameron Administration President and all - the Gentleman from St Mary's proclaimed
                  the treason of Cameron. I did not go to dress parade. The news of the burning of
                  Charlestown, and the demand of England for the restitution of [?] and [?] came on
                  us. I believe if there is would be anything which could rouse a great enthusiasm
                  in the north, even greater, it would be the prospect of a brush with England. The
                  old hatred lingers. We would do it as readily as the [?] nation would pitch into
                  it. Beaver and Little have went to town to visit the ladies.</p>

               <head>Tuesday 17th</head>
               <p>This is again another bright fine day. The court of inquiry was ordered to be held
                  at Col. d'Epineuil's headquarters, at Mr. Welsh's. Col Bell and I walked over. It
                  warm enough to have the window open - the air clear and bracing. The Col called
                  his wife down to have some music. She was dressed in a dark brown dress faced with
                  yellow, a red Zouave cap with yellow tassel. After the Court adjourned Col Bell
                  and I started out and after we got down the lane, we saw the Maj coming with Mrs
                  D'Epineuil, she dressed in full Zouave costume, which she told me belonged to one
                  of the drummer boys. She said she was going with the expedition if Gen Burnside
                  would permit - she thought if she dressed as a Zouave he would not object, as she
                  would not be in the [road?] She said she did not know what she would do if she
                  were not to go along, as she had no relative or friend out of Europe. I found a
                  box from home, when I got back to quarters - shoes, turkeys, chickens, butter
                  &amp;c and an excellent photograph of Papa and Mother. George and I went to town
                  this evening - found out nothing but that they were loading transports. 100 men
                  are detailed from our Regiment for Patrol duty, &amp; Lt Morris is detailed as the
                  Lt of the Guards.</p>

               <head>December 18 Wednesday 18. 1861</head>
               <p>Still fine weather. We went over to the Court of Inquiry, we adjourned from the
                  House to the Col's headquarters. His tent is nicely fitted up. Has a writing desk
                  like the one in my reading room. We examined witnesses for defence. The butler got
                  us up a dinner of steaks - there were large and we incontinently each ate one.
                  Rice and bread constituted the other parts of the feats. The Col has a frame of
                  wood put up around inside the wall tent, &amp; in stead of tent pole has two
                  forked stakes put up - this prevents the wind from affecting the tent. We sat
                  until late at night. Col Martin spoke of the man that was shot for desertion at
                  Washington - that the bullets did not go through him, though the detail that fired
                  were but 6 paces from him. Col. Maggi explained it by saying that the bullets of
                  rifles acquired their penetrating force only by passing through the air a certain
                  distance - the wind - and they do not yet require that at six paces. Col Maggi
                  &amp; Col Monteil said that they never went through a campaign in which they did
                  not lose their baggage - when different divisions marched on the same line - got
                  mixed, crossed each other, and the baggage one lost never reached their
                  destination. I can easily see how it would be, from what little I know. A division
                  or even a brigade hardly ever knew what regiments composed another - especially
                  one division never knew what Regiments composed another &amp; baggage may be
                  easily lost. I remember the night we went to Centreville, several divisions came
                  up and crossed each other. Our division got in between the baggage train of the
                  N.Y. [Fire?] Zouaves and their regiment - and their baggage train got in between
                  mine. I had charge of Gen Franklin's brigade train, and our division, &amp; I had
                  some trouble to find our brigade. Tom Grier and I started to walk to town: the
                  21st Mass is relieved of their charge of the railroad by the 11th Pennsylvania.
                  The guards of the latter were all drunk and unfit for duty - no wonder with the
                  example set by Col. Dick Coulter We went into [Dunkers?] for oysters: the Editor
                  Baily &amp; Dr Jackson 11th Penna - were talking and drinking - Baily giving the
                  Doctor an account of all the ills he suffered since he was a boy - especially that
                  he had bad lungs &amp; a cough and never was free from it until he was afflicted
                  with a fistula during the last [?]. The Legislature was in session - they were
                  just starting a vote on the resolution - Many of the members protested against the
                  6th some the 4th but voted aye for the sake of the message of the resolution. We
                  returned about twelve o'clock finding Dick Coulters men drunker than ever.</p>

               <head>December 19th Thursday. 1861.</head>
               <p>Another bright, fine day. We had another grand review by Gen Foster today. We
                  formed on the parade about ten o'clock. It was long tedeious and tiresome. Gov
                  Hicks the Pres of the Senate and House on horseback - and some twenty or thirty
                  indiscreet members who walked. They got very tired, and when they got to our
                  regiment the 7th they hung their heads like tired dogs, &amp; never looked up at
                  us - one old fat fellow puffed and blowed - We made a calculation - that they
                  walked 24 times across the field the length of the Regiment, and twice across
                  along it, making a distance in the aggregate of three miles. I was a little [?]
                  and our men were very tired standing there so long, - and did their marching
                  rather carelessly - then having to march in review once in quick time and once a
                  double quick - we were tired too - What must have been the State of the
                  Legislature. Lt. Col. Potter N.Y. 51st came and took dinner with us and spent the
                  afternoon, as also Lt. Col. Bell. We had a very pleasant time. He told us that
                  Sec. Seward was a very hard drinker - that is he was always sober before dinner
                  but after dinner drank a great deal. He said he took him home from dining at Lord
                  John Russells, in England, in his carriage very boozy. He uses tobacco excessively
                  too. I noticed at Washington at his levee that I thought he drank a good deal, but
                  afterwards thought it was only because he was a high [color?] The Lt.Col. gave us
                  a very comic description of a negro sermon preached in Annapolis. Are not Abana
                  and Pharpar rivers of Damascus &amp;c. I forgot the rest: but he went on to
                  describe the leprosy - called it a noble disease - appeared to have some idea that
                  it was a disease peculiar to noblemen. In giving a description of the scene at the
                  house - He sent the servant in: the servant comes out. Massa is in de inner room
                  and can't be seen - When he was in the river - he says he wallowed and dived and
                  wallowed and dived - &amp; when he had dived a number of times - his servant
                  called and dive again Massa &amp; he dived - When the prophet told him to go bathe
                  in the Jordan seven times - then [?] bust out - Are not Abana &amp; Pharpar. The
                  Lt Col was at our dress parade, but we did most miserably. Pride will have a [?]

               <p>We went over to hold Court, adn had just been seated when we got the order to
                  prepare for review. We adjourned and I got back just as the Regiment was moving
                  off. The review was by Gen Burnside at last. The New York <pb n="9"/>

                  <date>December 20 Friday continued 1861</date> 57th came in just in time on double
                  quick. Burnside is a fine, sharp dark eyed looking man, and rode a beautiful
                  horse. He has black hair whiskers along the side of the face. The review passed
                  finely in the same order as the other days I spent the afternoon in looking of
                  McClellans bayonet exercise. This evening Gib and I went to town, called at Dr
                  Claude, to see Miss Burton, but she was not at home. Going along the street we met
                  a miserable looking white [man?], worse with whiskey, who was asking a negro wench
                  to go home with. "I don't want company" "I can see myself home." We went into the
                  National Hotel but recently opened. I remembered the last time I was in here, sick
                  and weak and miserable, I enjoyed the hospitality of Mr Monroe and his pretty
                  little wife. Last Spring - I had been officer of the guard all night - attack
                  witih diarrahea - He took me there - put me in the nicest whitest bed so it seemed
                  to me - I had not seen a bed for [three?] weeks - and told me to sleep until 2
                  o'clock when they dined - I had been in bed but an hour when he came and wakened
                  me, saying that he was sorry to disturb me, but that orders to march had reached
                  the Regiment. I had been sent for. I jumped and with a [larity?], at which he
                  seemed surprised - &amp; with a cup of tea I bid them good bye - my last look was
                  at his pretty wife. I got a glimpse of them as the Regiment marched past. He has
                  gone to Frederick where he has a female seminary in successful operation. He moved
                  about two weeks before we came here.</p>

               <head>Saturday 21st</head>
               <p>A bright day, but much colder. This evening on dress parade I felt the cold strike
                  across my feet considerably. We finished The testimony of the Court of Inquiry
                  about one o'clock. Maggi in despite of his indignant protest of yesterday,
                  [because?] Lt Col Monteil was put in close arrest, was back as counsel. We had
                  Capt [Allabaugh?] and Capt Bell at our tent to tea this evening. Had roast
                  chicken. Col Bell was in and told us that there were 19 transports lying in the
                  bay. This looks favorable for our speedy departure. Gen Reno, a Pennsylvanian, is
                  the Commander of our Brigade. Do we have 3 regulars of the finest reputation:
                  Burnside, Foster and Reno - who was instructor of infantry tactics at West Point.
                  Col. [Hartranft?] told us that he had received a letter from the paymaster stating
                  he would be here to pay us off on Monday. Lt Col. Potter is a son of Bishop Potter
                  of Pennsylvania, of the Episcopal Church.</p>

               <p>Another fine day, though cold. Had company inspection at ten oclock. Then we had
                  orders to form our companies without arms and accoutrements &amp; march to the
                  parade ground, where we had a sermon by the Rev Mallory, our chaplain, "I am the
                  way and the life" After dinner Beaver, Tom Grier and I went to town. We went by
                  the wagon road to take a view of the camps though we commenced the adornment with
                  ever greenes and have the advantage of the situation the yankees have taken up the
                  idea and have gone ahead of us. The 10th Connecticut have archs wreaths &amp;c.
                  The arch over the main street has an eagle with oustpread wings worked in pine.
                  The N. York 31st have an arch in which 1776 worked in pine as also flags, and
                  other devices. We went down to the warf and saw the river covered with vessels
                  some one told us there were twenty four transports. some are large side wheel
                  steamers - I noticed the New Hampshire New York . Most of the others are painted
                  black. I suppose they would not afford as fair a mark for artillary as the white
                  ones. As we came back up the railroad I noticed we saw a train bringing in the 7th
                  Rhode Island Battery. The preparations are so great that it is supposed that it
                  will be ten days before we will be able to start. Beaver staid in to attend
                  church. Tom and I went into the yard of the Episcopal church where there are
                  several old tombstones - rectangular tombs of white marble. By itself at the
                  corner of the church is one [?] to the memory of Margaret Carroll, relict of
                  Charles Carroll, daughter of Matthew Tilghman, born January 15, 1742, died March
                  14, 1818. Over by the side of the church, was that of Rebecca wife of Daniel
                  Pulaney, daughter of Col. Walter Smith died March 18. 1737. aged 47 years.
                  Enclosed in an iron railing were those of William Bladen died August 9. 1718.
                  Benjamin Tasker Jun. late Secretary of Maryland died October 17. 1760 aged 39.
                  Honourable Benjamin Tasker died 18. June 1768 aged 78, "which , tho of a
                  constitution naturally weak and tender he attained through the efficiency of an
                  exemplary temperance. At the time of his death he was President of the council a
                  station he occupied 32 years. The offices of the agent and Receiver General &amp;
                  Judge of the prerogative court he successfully exercised." I observed the other
                  day the chickens roosting on the branches of a low tree over the latter tomb, and
                  Tom scraped away the piles of excrement in order to decipher the inscription. It
                  has begun to rain this evening about nine o'clock. </p>

                  paymaster having arrived. Maj Morill [and his?] assistant Mr Morton. As there were
                  some errors we had ours to make over - or rather for them as they had made most of

                  until the 16th of November. The first Lt receives pay from the time he was
                  entitled who mustered in, but is when we had 41 men - although not actually

                  This evening Beaver Tom and I went into Annapolis. It was more lively than I ever
                  saw it. We went to Episcopal service. The church is very beautiful inside, with
                  arches, and stained windows, and the evergreen decorations were beautifully
                  contrasted on the chaste white walls. The children sang a Christmas carol after

               <p>This was a bright fine day. Some of the companies went into town under charge of a
                  commissioned officer. We had almost a rebellion because we declined doing it. It
                  was very fortunate we didn't. They had a dreadful row in town - some hundred of
                  our men getting drunk, and having a free fight in the centre opening behind the
                  Episcopal church. [Gen. Reno?], I hear, was drunk, got knocked down twice and a
                  tooth knocked out. The dress parade was slim owing to so many absences. The detail
                  from our Regiment was happily relieved today and returned to camp. We presented
                  each of our men with a pair of white gloves. They looked quite fine on dress
                  parade. They appear to be satisfied that they did not get to town, especially when
                  they saw that the Col. collected all the old barrels in camp, and made the drunk
                  party should[er] them, and walk the [sing?]. Beaver &amp; Shorkly went to town

                  Washington and slipped off down here. Bill Schaffley and Frank Beale went to
                  Washington this morning. The weather was cold and windy and drilling was
                  disagreeable, beside that the men had lost considerable by the inaction of the

                  and we were ordered to drill the manual. It was exceedingly cold, so we had to
                  double quick to keep warm. Unfortunately for me Gen Reno came on to the drill
                  ground just as the other companies were gone, but I was still there, &amp; he saw
                  us go into the manual. I apologized by stating that we never got our muskets until
                  the day we left Harrisburg, &amp; we had to pay most attention to marching to keep
                  up with the Regiment. He made the remark to Col Bell that we must drill more in
                  the manual, &amp; mentioned Co. H. I felt badly all day about it. He caught the
                  Col &amp; Lt Col as bad, absent from camp. He [inspected?] Adjutant Bible dry.
                  Bible is a fellow that don't know anything and knows too much. The Gen stood us up
                  wonderfully. I went to town with John Morris this afternoon, who felt gay, because
                  he had just been appointed aide du camp to Gen Reno. We took a look at the
                  transport fleet - then took tea among at the City Hotel. T here we saw Gen Hatch a

                  that we were to embark tomorrow at twelve o'clock. We were busy this afternoon [?]
                  down our baggage. George &amp; Gib went to church this evening. I staid at home
                  and wrote some letters. We feel quite good in the prospect of marching, if only we
                  were a little better drilled.</p>

               <p>We discovered today that we misunderstood the order; that it was that Commander of
                  Regiments should hold themselves in readiness to march on twelve hours notice. So
                  we spent the day as usual in drill. [On?] Saturday the Regiment rec'd new coats -
                  &amp; now look like soldiers, and make a fine appearance. Frank Beale returned
                  from Washington, and bid us good bye. I sent my gold watch home with him, and
                  bought his silver watch: paid him in full for it - $20. Tom Grier has been
                  detailed as clerk to the Asst adjutant Gen of Gen. Reno.</p>

               <head>Tuesday 31st.</head>
               <p>Still bright fine weather. We were mustered today. Nearly 700 men out or more
                  perhaps - dressed in their best. We made a splendid appearance. They are drawn as
                  in review, in open order - The rolls are called - each man comes to a support and
                  as his name is called comes to a shoulder and then to an order. Every man must be
                  accounted for whose name is on the rolls. We then had inspection and review - As
                  we were marching in review Gen Reno &amp; staff, Lt Morris on his gallant bay. Lt
                  Reno, &amp; Gen Park commander of the third brigade came in. They complimented our
                  marching. Lt Reno told Beaver in town that company H marched finely, and were well
                  drilled. Morris told us that they all said we did the finest drilling of any
                  Regiment in the expedition, &amp; they had been around to all the camps today. We
                  had Regimental drill during the afternoon. We think we are still improving. During
                  the muster this morning - it was warm and pleasant. The parade ground is large
                  &amp; level, and the slight frost melting made part of it greasy. The sun was
                  bright and fine - the arms glistening in the sun, and a solemn stillness resting
                  on the whole scene. Then came rushing across the field a big boar, his bristles
                  sticking up, and after him two niggers and two dogs; the boar grunted, the dogs
                  barked, &amp; the niggers made all sorts of noises. The hog, as usual with hogs,
                  ran just the opposite way they wanted to drive him - indeed the plan of action,
                  between the dogs the niggers and the hog, was so complicated, that it was
                  impossible to tell which way they wanted to drive him - after a performance
                  unequalled by any circus I have ever seen, they retired and the audience, the
                  whole regiment was convulsed with laughter. <pb/> [?] I had my likeness taken
                  today. This evening we had our school of sergeants and corporals. I could not help
                  thinking how differently we would all have spent it if we were at home. The
                  Zouaves rebelled today and would come out on muster. &amp; this camp was put in
                  charge of two companies of the Connecticut Regiment. Thus endeth the year 1861. I
                  cant remember how the last day of last year was spent, but I'm sure that I never
                  dreamed of being in canvas walls, so far south as to have splendid weather. One of
                  our men returned who had been to Union County on furlough. I now commenced on the
                  other side of Baltimore &amp; in Union County there was sleighing. Here it about
                  like the pleasant days of [October?] I will now close this up and start anew -
                  &amp; send this home. Tom. Grier is not with us &amp; we feel like as if we were
                  waiting for him all the time. </p>

               <p>This was a warm fine day. We had [squall] and company drill, Regimental and dress
                  parade and that took up the major portion of the day. I never [adu] a New Year day
                  so pleasant and beautiful in weather. We drew new caps and distributed them. This
                  evening it has become exceedingly windy - it blows like a gal around our tent up
                  here on the hill, but we are safe enough yet. I don't know how it will be before
                  morning. We have some funny characters in our company; so different and of all
                  sorts and shades - such as it is said are required to make up a world. From the
                  Captain to Dick Langly our servant, from [Wilter] the tallest man down to [Beur]
                  the smallest, from [Newhart] the orderly to Campbel the 5th Sergt, from Allison

               <head>Monday January 6 1862</head>
               <p>Yesterday, Sunday, we knew that we were to break camps and embark. We were busy
                  making preparations: packing and fixing. About four o'clock the paymaster came. We
                  had the [mall?] signed, and towards seven o'clock were paid. We had orders to cook
                  three days provisions, but they did not draw provisions until late in the evening,
                  and the men were nearly all night cooking. It commenced to snow a little on
                  Saturday night, was cold and blustering during yesterday, sleeted during the
                  night. It was hard work. Besides the wood gone wet, and the men had to go to the
                  woods and get wood. Then we were busy bringing up packages for the men to send
                  money home. This morning dawned a wintry scene - snow about two inches. [Our]
                  beautiful camp was soon destroyed - It was wonderful what amount of truck gathered
                  [?] housekeeping for six weeks. The men gathered boxes and barrels and made
                  bonfires [?] I used was dispatched to town with the money packages amounting to
                  some fifteen hundred dollars. The little ground moles that burrowed about our tent
                  [?] had to [?] fare well - our shrubbery, [urch?] &amp; I went to the Bonfires.
                  About twelve o'clock the general [beat?], and we marched, leaving only marks of
                  where we had been. Lots of niggers around gathering the odd ends of crackers, old
                  shoes &amp; other things which necessity made us wasteful of. We marched through
                  town, and at the centre at the church, Companies C, A, K &amp; L separated,
                  carrying with them the old [Fourth?] colors, now attend to 51st and so command of
                  Lt Col Bell, markching to the city wharf to embark on the Scout. The rest of us
                  went down into the Navy Yard, and after little delay we embarked on the Cossack
                  steamer. This is a fine ocean steamer and the officers have the ladies cabin for
                  quarters. Most of my company are in the state rooms. But the poor fellows left
                  with the baggage have not come on board yet. The officers have no baggage and
                  nothing to eat. We managed to get a poor cup of tea. The scene in town was awful.
                  The shop keepers were set crazy and many in despair closed their stores.
                  Everything was bought out. The Bakers were fairly demented. The Express office
                  gave out and drove everybody away. All the troops here were paid off - everybody
                  was saying - the 21st Mass got drunk. Every fellow that could get liquor got &amp;
                  how was a mystery to us. Sunday was an awful day in town. Stores closed - troops
                  marching - everybody on the street. Tonight it is a beautiful scene on the water:
                  we got aground and had to be towed off - [We?] drifted down the stream - It is a
                  bleak wintry night - the waters dark - the river full of black hulled vessels,
                  with their signal lights aloft. The ships full of men, the bands playing - the
                  sound of the fiddle, the song and shout of the men. If we only had something to
                  eat. The reporters for the press, six of them, occupy a table and state rooms - a
                  table by themselves, with little slips of paper written [full?] - Then they had a
                  meal - coffee and ham fried, which was particularly tan- talizing to us. We ate a
                  full breakfast this morning, but a breakfast don't last all day. We have luxurious
                  quarters down here, but after all one's comfort should very materially on the
                  arrangements made for your stomach. My canteen full of water tastes delicious.
                  Dick filled it for me at the spring just before we started. Our Brigade now
                  consists of the 21st Mass 51st N.Y. 51st Penna 19th New Jersey 1240 strong 69th
                  New York. Tom Grier goes with Gen Reno on the Northerner. As Seth could not get
                  into the Express Office, Beaver gave my package of money to [steamer $340?] of my
                  own, $50 of [bandine?], $40 [Seth's?] &amp; $30, in all. We fortunately carried
                  our knapsacks with us, in which I have my portfolio, &amp; writing material,
                  cigars, and a blanket: so that we are comfortably better off [?] other officers.
                  We managed to get 30 loaves of bread - so that we are not starved - but it would
                  be a luxury to have our coffee hot, and that boiled ham that we have in the camp
                  chest together with a morsel of butter.</p>

               <head>On board Steamship Cossack Tuesday January 7 1862</head>
               <p>I slept splendidly last night and we turned out about seven o'clock. We began to
                  wonder where breakfast was to come from, when Lt Shorkley was appointed commissary
                  for the officers, and under his energetic supervision we had breakfast dinner and
                  supper. He and Beaver were out nearly all day laying in a stock of provisions. The
                  ship Cossack was formerly the Eastern [?] and is now painted black - it was
                  evidently painted white before. It is an ocean steamer I think used between
                  Portland Maine &amp; Boston or New York. It is about 300 feet long and sixty wide.
                  The lady's cabin, the officers quarters, is about 30 or more feet long - has
                  thirty berths, - Brussels carpet - dainty curtains - [secess?] - a washing place -
                  large mirrors &amp; otherwise like all those large steamboats. This was a bright
                  fine day, and this evening the moon is shining over the waters - the ships and
                  steamboats with their signal lights - the light house - the snow covered banks -
                  make a lovely scene - Add to this the bands in every ship are playing - Ours is
                  now playing Dixie - they played it first before the general was beaten - as we
                  left our camping ground yesterday. I amused myself up on deck with my glass - then
                  reading A message from the sea. The wind was pretty high this morning : it rocked
                  our boat very slightly. I felt the dizziness without exactly knowing exactly what
                  it was until I look out of the windows and saw the waves running pretty high. We
                  have everything embarked and ready except our horses. Another Regiment came down
                  from Washington, I think a Connecticut Regiment, so that all are now embarked. The
                  British ship [Imolita?], 37 Armstrong guns, is lying off the light house. Her
                  officers were in town - Capt Hancock - and they told their officers that they had
                  been sent to bring away Lord Lyons, had not the difficulty been settled. The
                  British ungenerous exaltation over what they call our back - out, will only serve
                  to increase that American feeling for a fight, which will burst out in violence
                  some of these days. We have now an immense army - soldiers training for fight, and
                  they will need employment. I received two letters by this mornings mail, one from
                  John and one from Laura. When I come to think of it, it seemed like yesterday that
                  I received it. This day has been long and short. John Morris was in and told us,
                  that Gen Reno, had been so heartily disgusted with the 21st Mass. for being
                  generally drunk, that he threatened to remove his staff from the Northerner to our
                  boat. Maj. Clark urged him to wait till this morning, when he said if it were no
                  better he would do so. Morris looks as gay riding around in the little boats as he
                  does on his bay. He is very popular and the men think if any thing can be done
                  Morris will do it. I was just coming down stairs to hunt berths for some men, when
                  I met the officers of the boat rushing up stairs. I went our to the side &amp; saw
                  the them lower the captain's gig in hot haste. I went out to the other side and
                  heard the most agonizing scream of drowning men "I'm drowning" "let go my legs"
                  &amp;c I waited until the officers returned. They reported they had rescued four
                  men, one clinging to the wheel and three on the surf boards. The side wheel
                  steamer run over a boat of the [?], [?] it is said with 23 men nineteen of whom
                  were saved. I was in harrowing suspense until I found out that it was not one of
                  our boats. [?] returned with three of our men just after it happened. Part of the
                  8th Connecticut are on board the [?]. It was bright moonlight - we could see the
                  men struggling in the water, and their screams were awful. I heard on firm manly
                  voice raise above the din of the confusion, "Keep cool its all right" and at once
                  it all seemed to subside. The side wheel boat has been considered the nuisance of
                  these waters running in to every one. It must have been gross carelessness to have
                  run into the boat on such a night as this.</p>

               <head>Wednesday January 8.</head>
               <p>There is a square rigged brig lying out near us, which was captured on New Year's
                  day endeavouring to run the blockade off the mouth of James River. I just learned
                  the distinciton in ships. A schooner is a boat with 2 masts without yards. A
                  square rigged brig has two masts and yards. A hermaphrodite brig has two masts,
                  one with yards. A ship has three masts witih yards. A bark three masts, two with
                  yards. We learn this morning that the men in the boat last night, run over by the
                  wheel[?] steamer, were all saved &amp; doing well. They were of the 27th Mass.
                  Those supposed to be lost were on shore &amp; returned to the boat this morning.
                  First serj [very?] hurt, on recommendation of the surgeon, need a furlough for
                  sixty days, and has resigned his serjantry. This vessel is the former Eastern
                  duty, now named the Cossack. She is 237 feet long and 30 feet [beam?].</p>
               <p>It is really a beauiful sight on deck. There are some forty ships and steamers.
                  The day is bright - the wind blowing brisk, waters sparkling in the sunlight. The
                  Scout is just now 3 o'clock P.M. towed up - containing the balance of our
                  Regiment. It is said we will start at four o'clock. The steamers have [this?]
                  steam up. The first brigade is distinguished by a red flag. The second by a blue
                  flag. The latter is ours with no 2 on it. The Scout is numbered [8?]. Everything
                  looks brisk and lively. We have been hourly in expectation of moving. As it was
                  growing dark, a boat came around our bow - I was walking on deck - Lt Morris voice
                  sung out - "Cossack" "Aye Aye" I yelled. "Col Hartranft on board" "Yes sir" "Call
                  himm out". And the message was that the Captain should keep a good look out for
                  three rockets - Then the first gun would be a signal for the first brigade to
                  move: Two guns for the second. We have drill in the [manual?] on deck during the
                  day. I received a letter from Annie and one from John. George rec'd his pistol and
                  shoes from Philadelphia. He told me that there was a long crowd around the Express
                  office, &amp; happening to catch the Agents eye, he gave him the Freemason sign,
                  and was waited on immediately. Otherwise he might have waited all the day. We
                  spent most of the afternoon on deck, looking at the gay scene. My marine glass is
                  a very useful [auxilliary?] in our pleasures, and we are as much pleased with it
                  as any children with their toys. One of the notable characters among our Officers
                  is Lt Blair. He is the man that things dress parade a humbug, and his own careless
                  unofficer appearance indicates his tastes - the size of his shirt collar is a
                  wonderful and straight out - pointed - like his black eyes - like his nose, like
                  his disposition - sharp, pointed, cutting. He is extreme in all his views -
                  expresses everything in a sharp way. He always turns up in any discussion; he
                  dislikes adjutant, and hammers him unmercifully. The Adjt is slow at repartee.
                  Blair has been Lt of the Guard today and his oddities and eccentricities have
                  appeared in a very prominent manner. He has demonstrated on Lloyds map that our
                  ship the Cossack is to land at [Apalachicola?] and go up and take possession of
                  the Railroad at [Talahasse?] - Lt Col Bell is to [stand?] at Cedar Keys - Florida
                  - [with?] the "Scout" and hold the road there - &amp; then the United States
                  holding [Formadina?] - then we had possession of Florida. Our steam is up &amp; we
                  will probably be off tonight.</p>

               <p>I was wakened this morning about 6 o'clock by the cry of a "man overboard." That
                  cry is fearful enough at any time, but to be waked out of sleep, in the dark of
                  the morning and hear it, and the cries of the drowning man, and that gulping noise
                  he makes as he [be?] swept rapidly by the stern of the ship. However I was not
                  startled. I got up however and tried to look out the window of Shorkly's berth. He
                  was turned round and said there was no use of getting up, we must get used to
                  these things. I went out to the back window and saw a number of little boats
                  flying about. One husky voice - salty - I remember the first time I heard such a
                  voice - the night we came down from Perrysville to Annapolis last spring when we
                  were hailed by the Cumberland, and ordered to haul under his stern - I have
                  noticed it since in all sailors - this husky voice called out "Keep the lad up"
                  "Keep the lad up." Then again another just as husky cried out "I've got him"
                  "Heave him up" "Put your arm around me, lad." Then I knew he was safe. In the army
                  when they speak to a man, they say "My man" [on sea?] "My lad." The three rockets
                  went up about seven o'clock - then one gun fired - and the first brigade got under
                  way. Then two guns and our brigade started about a quart past eight. We have two
                  ships in two - 7 &amp; 8 - 8 is the Scout with the balance of our Regiment. Gen
                  Burnside in a small boat, eight or ten oarsmen, went shooting about from ship to
                  ship - cheered by all of us as he passed. He had a common cavalry hat &amp; [gum?]
                  coat. The bands saluted as he passed, we waved our hats, the men cheered. On each
                  ship as it started the band commenced playing Dixie. I have spent most of the
                  morning out looking at the fleet. How proudly they plough their way. Our vessel
                  seems the staunchest and fastest sailor. I recognized Lt. Col. Potter on one of
                  the ships (3) waved my hat to him, he turned to his men, did something in dumb
                  show - but we heard a cheer burst from them, and we cheered in return. We passed
                  the English [Imolite?] off the Light House. England is rousing a terrible feeling
                  in our hearts. There will be a great war some of these days. I can't keep it down
                  in myself. The officers spoke of it with an ill-concealed glare, that it was an
                  insult to have that lying there. The ill concealed exultation of the British and
                  their mentioning with such satisfaction that there are so many French war vessels
                  on our coast, is making up the [desired?] indiganation in the breast of those most
                  opposed to war, and least blood thirsty in feeling. [A?] five beels [at?] 2
                  o'clock afternoon passed Cove pt, Drum point and the mouth of the Pautuxet River.
                  This evening at the request of Bently reporter for the Philadelphia Enquirer, I
                  wrote out a list of our company with their residences, and took it up to his room.
                  He introduced me to McDonald the reporter for the Commercial Advertiser. Captain
                  Bennet, Captain of my Boat came in and told us to come out and see a beautiful
                  sight. He took us to the stern of the ship, [and?] see the wake of the ship. The
                  moon was not very bright, the waters like dark green glass - a wake as broad as
                  the ship, as straight as an arrow, extending as far back as the ships we had in
                  tow, boiling an foaming white - It was indeed beautiful. We went back to the
                  Reporter's room. Bennet gave us a succinct history of his life - 22 years at sea -
                  master of a ship at 18 years of age - Keeper of the Minot Ledge light house -
                  saved by being accidentally away when it washed into the sea - where he lost all
                  his charts, drawings - having been three times around the world - were peculiarly
                  valuable to him: joined his fate with Mayor Wood of New York - Capt of the 5th
                  ward police - went into the custom house - had his head cut off for his connection
                  with Mayor Wood - and with difficulty, and owing to his personal acquaintance with
                  Welles and Burnside and his position here. He was superintendent of the outfitting
                  of this fleet at New York. He has a little boy ten years old perhaps, that cried
                  to go along. Burnside happened to be by. The boy said he would carry cartridges
                  and do many other things - Burnside told him to take him along and he woudl allow
                  him [?] While we were standing on the Hurricane deck this evening the sky was
                  mottled white and long streaks dark along the western sky. Bently came over the
                  sailors Rhyme [A anackered sky and make waves high And mares tails, and covers the

               <head>Friday January 10 1862.</head>
               <p>The boat stopped last night about eleven o'clock on account of the density of the
                  fog. This morning the fog was still very thick, could not see fifty paces ahead.
                  About nine o'clock there were signs of clearing &amp; the Captain ordered the
                  engines to get up steam. We are still thirty miles from Hampton Roads. Some time
                  after we started. We had dinner at half past 12 o'clock, and we went on deck. Soon
                  we saw the masts of vessels looming through the fog. Then the red light boat, the
                  [Kipowaps] Sewells point and fortress Monroe There were three men of war - the
                  sailors manned the yards and cheered. We cheered in return. We soon recognized
                  some of our acquaintances. The New York, New Brunswick. We dipped our flag as we
                  came in. We anchored off the fortress toward Sewall's point. The [?] are a heap of
                  rocks out to the left of us, with some stone walls, 2 stone houses, and some poles
                  with ropes tretched. I saw but on cannon perched up pointing toward Sewalls point.
                  It looked an acre or so in extent, and is exactly like the summit of Mount
                  Washington. Willoughby point was [?] on the red light boat. The day cleared, but
                  it was still smoky - we looked with interest upon the places we had so often read
                  about. We were all soon in the cabin preparing our letters to send home. I wrote
                  one to Aunt Margery, one to the Chronicle and one to Annie. We went up after
                  supper, but saw nothing but a gunboat out towards Sewalls point, used as a
                  watch-boat. Lt Col Bell came on board and took tea with us. It was so foggy that
                  we could see nothing until we entered Hampton Roads. Sewalls Point is a long low
                  reach of sand, covered with woods. I could see a house and barn a mile perhaps
                  from the point. We could not distinguish anything at all on the point, except that
                  the sand appeared who reached up along the edge of the wood, but that may have
                  been done by the action of the waves. The fleet here is not so imposing in
                  appearance, as up at Annapolis - perhaps because the harbor is wider. Hassenflug,
                  and John Smith, the Col's servant were the only ones that were sea-sick. Teh
                  adjutant has a great time with his consolidated reports, and each Captain has to
                  make one every time, to rectify mistakes &amp;c. It is the great bore of all of us
                  and especially the adjutant. Blair remarked that he expected that the adjutant,
                  when he died, would take the form of a consolidated report.</p>

               <head>Sunday 11.</head>
               <p>This was a bright fine day. A lot of us got into a surf boat and went o shore. We
                  first went to the Fortress. It is immense and the number of cannon surprised us. I
                  think it is a mile and a half around the ramparts, and enclosese 80 acres. In the
                  inside are houses for officers and quarters, and trees - live oak. The 10th N.
                  York Vols or National Zouaves are quartered in it. Their uniform light blue, with
                  [pink Solfine trimming?] We saw the Union Gun down on the beach, 12 inch bore, and
                  the Floyd lying beside it, not mounted. There are an immense number of guns, many
                  of them ten inch, lying outside. 150 at least are mounted. Grass is grown over the
                  piles of ball inside. From one side we saw Camp Hamilton, and the ruins of
                  Hamilton - nothing but the stacks of chimnies standing up, like ghosts. We went to
                  a store - a little store but got everything you asked for. I got some drawing
                  paper. The grocery also furnished everything wanted at very advanced prices
                  however. Capt. Cook, formerly of the old Fourth met us on the beach and came pver
                  amd tppl dinner with us. I amused myself trying to sketch the [?] - but the vessel
                  kept swinging around and I was so slow that I did not succeed &amp; wound up my
                  labors sketching a hermaphrodite brig lying near us. As the Adjt. came in Blair
                  says "There comes consolidated report." "Consolidated Bible" says Mallory. "Bound
                  in calf" says Blair. The "Scout" and the Brig that we towed sailed somewhere this
                  afternoon. Part of the fleet is gone. We have [to?] coal - 25 tons &amp; take in
                  water yet - 100 tons of coal last six days. Do we go up the Potomac? Up the James
                  River?We have our bay Pilot on board yet. Captain says he won't know but his pilot
                  will be changed. 1/2 past nine o'clock. P.M. Lt. Reno just came in, and gave
                  orders to get upstream and start. It may be interesting, hereafter, to note our
                  conjectures. Rodamel asserts that we will not go out of James River. Bently, the
                  reporter, says we are going to Lynhaven Bay - behind Norfolk. Beaver asserts that
                  we go to Savannah. The Col. said that we go to [Lece?]</p>

               <p>Ten o'clock P.M. anchor heaved and we start. The water in the roads smooth as
                  glass but it heaves now that we are out in the bay. The Col, rec'd sealed orders,
                  merely told us that we were going to sea. Blair gets the [?] but can't [fish?] it
                  yet. The Col. says he will tell us our destination in the morning. The commissary
                  says that there are no better [?] than we have. The chief engineer has been on
                  this boat 8 years, [?] in the stormy coast between Portland and St. Johns that she
                  was thoroughly overhauled at New York before coming to Annapolis - so that so far
                  as good steamanship, good enginners and a staunch boat can carry us we will go
                  safely. 12 o'clock, our bay pilot takes leave of us at the light ship, and we
                  steam out into the [?]</p>

               <head>Sunday Jan 12.</head>
               <p>We got awake this morning, with [rocking?] boat, dense fog - many with sick
                  stomachs. Some acknowledged it - others got quietly into their bunks and staid
                  there. Beaver went to his bunk and was sick all day. The Col was struck suddenly
                  after breakfast. Down in the hold and up on deck it was still worse. We stopped on
                  account of the density of the fog and laid by until afternoon. We saw the Picket
                  with Gen. Burnside on board. I felt a little reely after breakfast but an hour or
                  two on deck settled, and this evening I feel splendid. This afternoon it cleared
                  off, and I enjoyed the ride very much. We could see the low coast line to our
                  right about two miles, strewed with the wrecks of ships. Toward five o'clock we
                  came opposite Cape Hatteras, the wind blowing hard, and the sea very rough. There
                  were several attacks of sickness - Beaver being out most of the afternoon, retires
                  in intense disgust. We are now lying an and off Cape Hatteras waiting for a pilot.
                  I was on the Hurricane deck at sunset - it was delightfully exhilerating - rising
                  and falling with the waves - the spray breaking over the bow - the sunset was very
                  beautiful the orange and saffire - the ashes of roses - the long low sand beach of
                  Cape Hatteras, with its white shaft of Light House.</p>
               <p>Blair was officer of the day today - and luxuriated in the full reign of a sound
                  stomach. The adjutant was sick as well as the sentinels at guard-mounting - &amp;
                  Blair goes up and cooly tells them that no one should get sick without a written
                  permit signed by the Colonel. The white sea birds followed in our wake a long
                  while this afternoon on their untiring wing. We saw the Cossack as also the
                  Steamship City of New York off Cape Hatteras. One of the Reporters told me that it
                  was that ship, but I rather suppose it is one of the blockading flee. Along what
                  is called Bald Beach, the wrecks of vessels are very numerous. One Schooner
                  apparently lately wrecked, and what we took to be a tent pitched back of it. The
                  ship is rolling heavily this evening, and it is said we will have to stay outside
                  all night. Mr. Mallory told me this morning that they had heard in the Fortress
                  yesterday afternoon the destination of the fleet - that the news came through
                  directly from Norfolk - that we were to go to Hatteras Inlet, and our object was
                  to blow up some locks of some canal, to prevent the egress of a Rebel expedition
                  fitting out at Norfolk. It is said that there is a canal between Norfolk and
                  Albemarle sound - I can't find anything on the maps I have with me, but I think
                  there is what is called the dismal swamp canal. The Col's orders were to enter
                  Hatteras Inlet and wait. It seems strange that we can keep the intelligence only
                  from our own sailors. I was told by the World reporter that the notice of a
                  traitor being found in the family of a distinguished military officer, was that of
                  Adjt. Gen. Thomas, and his daughter was the one implicated. This information must
                  have come through some such source. Thomas is a Virginian by birth and residence
                  and on the breaking out of the war sent his slaves to Kentucky. I was told also,
                  by the same man, that on Friday night, one of the officers detailed on the signal
                  corps, was arrested endeavouring to escape over to Sewalls point, in a small boat,
                  having with him all the signals to be used in the expedition. I see by [?] map the
                  dismal swamp canal marked.</p>

               <head>Monday Jan 13.</head>
               <p>When I woke up this morning the ship was pitching and rolling very much. Every one
                  almost was sick. I went out to wash, and came back for a touch when it struck me
                  about the pit of the stomach - I got outside &amp; got well enough, until I came
                  in to get breakfast - &amp; had to rush out, and [put?] up all the bile in me.
                  About ten we arrived opposite Hatteras inlet &amp; in a half hour crossed the bar
                  and anchored opposite Ft. Clark. I could not help laughing at the woe begone
                  expression of the countenances for the last few days; John Smith, the Col's
                  servant suffered particularly. Dick was sick too until we stopped inside the bar.
                  Cap Snyder, Lt [Gaulen?], Beaver and several others were sick all the time. The
                  Col. was also in best most of his time. I had a sort of tremulous fear of it,
                  until last night, when though there was a good deal of high seas, I felt so well
                  that I had given up all expectation of being sick. During the night there was a
                  severe wind, and nearly every one on the boat was sick. I however slept through it
                  all - toward morning I wakened up by being nearly pitched out. I had no suspicion
                  of my own fate until I got up. I found Dick rolling around the floor, and after
                  the most ridiculous attempts falling over my trunk pitching in to Capt Shawl's
                  bread basket with my head, and seeing Capt. Shawl immediately after make a motion
                  as if he were going <pb n="22"/> to [die?], and landing head formost among a pile
                  of trunks. I steadied myself with one arm around a post, and managed to get my
                  stock on. I then went out to wash - &amp; coming back was seized with a burning
                  sensation in the pit of the stomach and commenced gaging: I rushed out, but it
                  ended in gaging. I went out on the side of the stern and lay there watching the
                  fleet. We were farthest out, just opposite Cape Hatteras. Between us and the shore
                  was a white steamer, the Eastern Queen, the George Peabody, having the little
                  propeller Picket in tow, and several other steamers following behind. They were in
                  the worst of the rolling waves, and rolled and pitched wonderfully: we could see
                  them roll down until the sides were covered. We could see Gen. Burnside standing
                  on the Deck of the Picket, seemingly unaffected. The propellers rolled like logs.
                  We soon stood in towards shore, and crossed the bow of the Peabody. A splendid
                  steamship came up past us, the Spaulding - the little gunboat pilot came out, she
                  hailed us, and asked our draft - 8 feet replied the Captain - "Too much sea to
                  cross the Bar." Our paddles stopped, but the Spaulding &amp; Picket made a dash.
                  It was a splendid sight - The waves rolling and chasing each other until they
                  broke in madness, dashing high the spray - the Spaulding went through, and we
                  followed hard after her, getting in before the little Picket. I stood on the
                  hurricane deck as we went through. Even our big boat pitched so that we had to
                  hold fast. But just before this I had been down aft - Foster came out pale and
                  dizzy looking - John Smith stuck his out of a little window - had colored in hue -
                  each making desperate efforts to relieve the stomach. Foster recovered and
                  proposed to go in to breakfast. I consented - went in - took a piece of ham -
                  &amp; was waiting for bread - when I was seized with an intense nausea - I started
                  aft - fell over a trunk overset the Col's table, which went down with a tremendous
                  clatter - &amp; succeeded in getting out to relieve myself of considerable bile.
                  Since then I have been perfectly well, except being weak from not having eaten
                  anything. Four o'clock we had dinner and a hungrier set of men were never seen -
                  Some had not eaten for two days. I feel most splendidly now. All have recovered
                  &amp; are in fine spirits. This is a dreadful windy place. We interested ourselves
                  in watching the other ships come through the inlet. Very few of the sailing
                  vessels have come through, owing to the head winds, and are riding outside. But
                  nearly all the steamships have arrived, and the harbor looks lively. The point is
                  a low beach of sand - Fort Clark near the point, with one or two [?] houses on it.
                  The inlet is but a quarter of a mile wide and very dangerous. The book
                  [prescribes?] that no one should go in without a pilot. When we reached Cape
                  Hatteras last evening, we turned back and ran north until midnight &amp; then
                  turned passing the light house at the Cape about nine o'clock. The 48th Penn Reg,
                  Col Nagle is on this place garrisoning Ft. Clark.</p>

               <p>It blowed fearfully and those outside the bar last night must have had a severely
                  rolling time last night. The little Picket, used by Burnside as his ship, is owned
                  by her Captain, named Ives, who is a wealthy man, and offered his services and
                  boat to the Government without pay and received a captain's commission. The
                  [Steamship at?] New York is fast on the bar. The surf is so bad that the tugs
                  can't get near it. And the captain won't allow a boat to go ashore. The Officers
                  Mess is out of provisions. We have no meat &amp; came down to the last scrapings
                  this morning. There is a little fellow, nominally a servant of Capt Blair, as
                  peculiar as Blair too, goes by the name of Bucktail. He is about 15 years old,
                  with small turned up features, wears a belt with a bayonet &amp; scabbard, large
                  blouse and large pants. He is from Tyrone Father &amp; Mother dead, all from
                  Tyrone - got into camp at Harrisburg, in the employ of some of the serjts - &amp;
                  one night about ten o'clock came up to Blairs tent, saying that they had turned
                  him out. He started with ten cents - [?] newspapers &amp;c - Blair [?] him five
                  dollars at Camp Union: because with his little capital he had to go to town so
                  often to replenish - He has paid that back - &amp; has now some ten or 15 dollars.
                  The other day he got [?] sea sick and some one told him to take a dose of salts.
                  He came in and wanted Blair to get him a dose, &amp; could hardly be persuaded to
                  the contrary. I think his name of Bucktail came from his having some kind of an
                  animals tail inned on to his hat. The wind has blown stormily all day. A little
                  gun boat dragged her anchor and has come against us twice. We have just heard this
                  evening that the Scout with other sailing vessels have come in. The steamship City
                  of New York is still aground - they cut away her mast, and her smokepipe came down
                  this afternoon. Of all desolate looking places this beach is the most desolate.
                  Those that hold her must have a very disagreeable time. We are getting down to the
                  originals in our officers mess. We have no soft bread. At noon we had pea soup and
                  hard bread, and the adjutant fished up a little bunch of butter out of his [have?]
                  sack and gave us a knife full. This evening we had hard bread, cooked rice and
                  tea.</p>

               <fw>Tuesday January 14. Hatteras Inlet</fw>
               <p>I remember of hearing Mother often remark that rice was such a tasteless thing
                  when cooked without milk. This was evidently cooked with water. We had no butter.
                  The hard bread is good - the tea is good the rice seasoned with salt, and sugar to
                  make it gritty was good. I don't know what we are to have tomorrow. I see
                  Commisary Shorkley in anxious consultation with the Quartermaster. We have seen
                  the ships lying outside all day - but I hear that most of them have got in. We
                  conjecture that the first attack will be on Roanoke Island. The surf ran so high
                  that the Captain would not allow his boats to go ashore, so that we have not had
                  any communication with any one.</p>

               <head>Wednesday January 15.</head>
               <p>It was foggy this morning. We could just see the "City of New York" laying out in
                  the [?] A boat came in to our ship with five men - they had swamped two boats
                  before they succeeded in getting off. The Captain lowered one of his boats, and
                  he, the Mate, the Col and &amp; Dr [Hossack?]started out. They arrived just in
                  time to see a little boat belonging to [?] Schooner take off the remaining crew.
                  Both boats came up to see us at the same time and Captain Bennet called to us to
                  cheer the little white boat, that had rescued the crew, which we did with a hearty
                  good will. The capt and mate went away again and shortly after, the Brig "Hope"
                  swung against us, pushed in our wheel house, and kept digging at us until it had
                  all the out side works on the [starberd?] side, at the stern crushed - opened out
                  our cabin knocking to pieces Capt Bell's berth. Mine just escaped. While this was
                  going on we saw Capt Bennet returning: I was standing at the side as the Captain
                  came up. Hi sboat shot past the place for getting on. He scolded his crew
                  remarking with a forcible ejaculation that he "wouldn't give a handful of cow-dung
                  for the whole of them" We got up steam, and the Brig was towed away, leaving our
                  stern pretty well smashed on one side. The City of New York" was loaded with 70
                  cases muskets and rifeles, ammunition, [hay?], shot and shell, and a great deal of
                  Officers baggage. She is lying on her side one side stoved in - the poor fellows
                  were on there for two days, and were clinging to her side when taken off. They had
                  no sleep for two days, and were 15 &amp; 1/2 feet, and why she should attempt to
                  cross with such a sea is owing to the government pilot. In calm sea she might have
                  made it as the channel is 17 feet. The sailors were pretty well whiskeyed when we
                  came on board. The Captain's name was Nye and the sailors spoke highly of him. The
                  Quarter master, Shorkley, Beaver, Jones and I got a boat, and with little
                  [Cubby?], a dark rich colored boy, with long dark locks, such luscious red lips
                  and black eyes, and another sailor boy, with a game eye, and big quid of tobacco
                  in his cheeck went over to the shore. We picked up some shells, saw Gen Williams
                  and staff, and went into Fort Hatteras, which is built of sods, having barrels
                  filled with sand for a foundation. There was a steam engine making fresh water,
                  and a ten inch gun outside. Three or four wrecked schooners, masts and remains of
                  many other wrecks on the shore. We had a gay time getting our boat off the beach -
                  as the surf rolled heavily. This morning as we were standing on deck, we saw a
                  boat run to shore, and they buried some poor sailor on the lonely beach. There
                  will be nothing to mark his grave - the waves will soon smooth down the little
                  hillock of sand - He'll always have storms and winds and dashing waves over him.
                  The ninth New York 48th Penna are on this beach. Company C. 1st [W.I.?] Artillery
                  have [?] Hatteras. Fort Clark is just above. Camp Bull is the N.Y. regiment &amp;
                  five miles above Camp [blank] of the 48th. We hear that the New Hampshire Regt is
                  to be landed &amp; the 9th N.Y. to go with us. Just as I was getting into the boat
                  I shook hands with Morris - the first I have seen him since we left Annapolis.</p>
               <p>Capt. Neal as adj. gen. came on board this evening, and told us that Col. Allen of
                  the 9th New Jersey and the surgeon of that Regiment were drowned. Their ship lay
                  outside, and they came in on the yawl - and in returning were overset. Their
                  bodies were recovered, and taken on board of the Highlander, a brig passing by. I
                  saw their little boat dancing in the breakers, and afterwards saw the Highlander
                  towed in, but I did not dream of the tragedy. I did not even observe that their
                  bodies were lying on deck, as some of the rest did, and that they were rubbing
                  there, and that their coats [?] up were those of officers. Just as they were
                  taking the bodies below deck, one of our sailors said "pretty hard boys, but it
                  can't be helped, drag 'em down." On the sern of one of the vessels which came in,
                  a woman was sitting. One of our fellows in his ecstacy cried out, "that sight's
                  worth a quarter, who shall I pay itto" turning round and plunging his hands into
                  his pocket. The engineer of the City of New York, as he left the boat tore off the
                  brass [?] in the engine room, and tied the colors around his neck.</p>

               <head>Ship Cossack. Hatteras Inlet. Thursday January 16 1862.</head>
               <p>The day was cold and rainy. One of Co D. James Conoway died last night of
                  consumption. They lowered him into the surf boat, the band playing the dead march,
                  and took him over to bury him on the lonely sand beach. The Col, Chaplain &amp; Dr
                  went along, but owing to the wind and tide they have not been able to return. The
                  Cap was out in a boat, and had to be towed back by a steam tug. This is a dreadful
                  stormy place. We loitered on deck this morning, the only thing of interest, to
                  watch our carpenters repairing our breaches, and the [tide?] heaving out barrels,
                  &amp; beds &amp; pieces of the wreck which it brought in last night. Dr Gibson
                  Chaplain of the 45th &amp; young Gregg came on board, &amp; would not get off on
                  account of the storm. They came from [Baltimore?] on a schooner, which turned in
                  on account of the storm, on their way to join the 45th at Port Royal. I amused
                  myself reading the army regulations and the Mill on the Floss. Lots of light
                  reading has turned up from somewhere, and as we can't drill, nor go ashore, we are
                  [?] down to it. Rations are severe. We had fried pork boiled potatoes hard bread
                  &amp; coffee for breakfast, boiled potatoes and soup for dinner - fried pork,
                  boiled rice and tea for suppr. Those that are fond of molasses relish it probably
                  best - but it comes quite natural to me. We have settled in our own minds that we
                  are going up to the Roanoke Island. When, we have not settled. Reportsare so
                  [covert?] and unfounded that I put no faith in them until I am completely
                  assured.</p>

               <head>Friday January 17. 1862.</head>
               <p>We raised anchor to go beyond the swash or bulkhead - a sand-bar just beyond the
                  inlet before you get into the Sound - but in getting down, we ran foul of the
                  chain of the anchor of the Rocket - Then we did not move for fear it would take
                  off our rudder. Then Haskell, - a man who was once in the common council of New
                  York - no credit, says Capt Bennet, except that he got their enmity by being
                  honest - he rendered signal service to the fleet at Port Royal, and on
                  recommendation of Foster was appointed to have superintendence over the fleet -
                  came over in the Phoenix, a bloack eyed, black mustachioed man, quick as a rat -
                  he said everything appeared to be unlucky - None of the propellers but one could
                  pass the swash; except steam tugs were to come, &amp; not one here - can't lighten
                  the ships nothing to do it with &amp; the Phoenix was sinking. A little boat came
                  along - "Mail on board [?]" Boat lowered and [Col cot] scuds away returning very
                  soon, holding up a bundle of letters as he hoves in sight. There was none for me
                  however, or Beaver or Shorkly. Dr Gibson and Curtin got on board the Phoneix -
                  don't know how the mean to manage their escape from Hatteras. The Col &amp;
                  Chaplain &amp; party returned this morning. Wind and tide kept them. The Chaplain
                  staid at Ft Hatteras with Capt Morris. Col &amp; Dr went up to Camp Winfield,
                  where the 48th is. Col went the rounds with Maj. Nagle. Most important they got
                  butter ham beef tongue and other things of the [?], which arrived in time - We had
                  Skoush thats the way its pronounced, a sort of pork pot pie - only crackers
                  instead of dough, and [?] for dinner. The unusual luxury of butter made its
                  appearance- so we had ham and beef tongue for tea. The "Scout" arrived to day at
                  last. They were blown out into the gulf stream, carried down as far as Pt. Lookout
                  - hadn't seen the sun for three days - were short of water - limited to a pint a
                  day - though we had given them up - and by this time the battle had been fought.
                  Every thing appears to [we expatiously] unlucky. We had a bad loss in the wreck of
                  the "City of New York" - a schooner and gun boat sunk. To night it is raining like
                  blazes - I expect before morning the wind will get up again, and some other craft
                  get foul of us. The Louis [?] is evidently in a dangerous condition. While we were
                  foul of the Rocket, some other steamer got aground in the channel of the swash so
                  we are kept here. We were aground half the time to-day. Well I suppose that we
                  will get out tomorrow. I only hope that tomorrow will be a sun-shiny day so that
                  we can get the decks &amp; hold cleaned. I am getting very anxious about that. We
                  can't keep it clean somehow. I finished reading The Mill on the Floss. I'm getting
                  used to storms, and look on wrecks with indifference. This is an abominable place.
                  I never expect to have such comfortable quarters as I have now, but the hold and
                  decks are a constant source of anxiety to me. Body lice, and infection of worse
                  diseases may be well [?] But it was decided again that we wouldn't move tonight.
                  So the Captain got to work to get his boat of himself. We got every man we could
                  out - crowded them on the bow - then double quicked aft - then from side to side,
                  but budge she wouldn't.</p>

               <head>Saturday January 18.</head>
               <p>Charles [Kleckner?], a Lieut in the 48th was on board yesterday. One of the
                  funniest things that has occurred is Dick's [last?] merchantile transaction. He
                  bought a box of cigars, 100, of the [cutter?] for five dollars, and went up stairs
                  and commenced selling them out at 3 cents apiece. The [cutter?] went up after
                  while and told him he was loosing 2 cents on every cigar. He was astounded, and
                  sold at 6, then became disgusted, and sold at five. He [managed?] to get out with
                  losing 25 cents, according to his own account. He paid that much for his
                  experience and will probably not embark in any more. We parted our cable this
                  morning in trying to get clear of a [bark?], and got aground, and spent most of
                  the morning in trying to get loose. We are still aground. Reno said we must be
                  over the [wash?] tomorrow morning , and this evening we are [onclad?] to get out,
                  arms and accoustic [events?] on board some tugs who are to take us over Another
                  [goon?] was sunk today, so we have lost two gunboats, a schooner or two - several
                  ships are fast aground. Mr Carpenter reports for [?], was on board this morning.
                  Also Capt. Potts of Reading or Pottsville. The day has been cold and windy. The
                  sun came out this evening, but this is a dreary day [wast?]. I could not sleep any
                  last night and this afternoon my bones ache all over. I hope I am not going to be
                  sick, and that it is only temporary, from being confined on board so closely, and
                  from want of exercise. see [ante?] for conclusion.</p>

               <head>Sunday Jan 19.</head>
               <p>It was very foggy during the forenoon - we were up early, had breakfast, and the
                  two ferry boats, Patuxent, Pond Curlew came alongside. We all got out, with arms
                  and equipments - our company getting on to the Patuxent. They were both fast to
                  the Cossack, and worked and pushed and crashed each others sides at a desperate
                  rate for a half hour. We began to fear that it would not move. While we were
                  watching it listlessly, both boats fell back &amp; raised together, and lifted the
                  Cossack right off - We held our breath awhile to be sure it was moving - we saw
                  all the other ships must be moving or else our long-hoped release had come - she
                  moved sure, and we gave three hearty cheers. A little regardless perhaps in the
                  delirium of moving again, the stem of the Patuxent struck a hole in our stern; it
                  was crowded with men - one was knocked off his feet and jumped into the light boat
                  - another pitched after him - The extent of the damage, however, was in [trawing?]
                  back of a musket, and breaking off the front teeth of one of our men Hugh McClure,
                  but it was a very narrow escape. We dropped astern and then hauled up to a
                  schooner &amp; lashed fast. We watched them unloading the horses from the Peabody.
                  It was anchored about 57 yards from shore - the horses pushed off the ship
                  tumbling down 4 of 5 feet until they reached the water, &amp; men in a boat lead
                  them by a rope to shore - It seemed a cruel way of doing it, but was accomplished
                  safely. They were trotted around on shore, until there was no danger of chill. The
                  Capt of the Patuxent is named Bennet, a short red faced man. The three Ferry Boats
                  Curlew, Pilot-boy were chartered at Philadelphia by the Government to go to Port
                  Royal and put in here on account of [?] of weather, &amp; Burnside put them in to
                  service. He used to run the Keystone state. He said he had been on this coast 16
                  years, and never knew such a week of such weather as last week. About 11 o'clock
                  we got back to our home in the Cossack. Our Captain Burnside, Reno &amp; the Pilot
                  were sounding the channel across the swash this afternoon. I spent the afternoon
                  reading. Some men from the Pocahontas came in the evening. They were wrecked about
                  15 miles above Hatteras light-house. Their boiler gave out during the storm,
                  anchored and dragged on shore - out of 120 horses save 17 - All the men were
                  saved. The Pilot told me this evening that it is 52 miles to Roanoke Island - that
                  any vessel that can cross teh swash would go up the Sound - but the rebels had
                  taken up all the light Boats and buoys. The name swash is probably a contraction
                  of sea-wash. We are anchored just inside the inlet, but before we can get into the
                  sound there is the swash - a shoal of sand yet to cross. We have a sea-shell
                  mania. Parties go out to the shore and collect shells - some are very beautiful -
                  some are lucky dogs and find nice ones. Others come in with a batch of very common
                  looking shells. They will be probably carried far <pb n="25"/>
                  <fw>Sunday January 19, 1862</fw> or lost long before they get home - but they
                  serve to fill the hour - the tedious monotonous hours. I find I have injured my
                  eyes reading in this dark cabin - I long to get back to my canvass home. We had a
                  New York Tribune today which states that the [John Trucks?] which had the Zouaves
                  on board, put back to Fortress Monroe.</p>

               <head>Monday 20.</head>
               <p>This is a bright lovely morning - the first one we have had - it is like a summer
                  day. We were loaded on to the Patuxent again, swung away from the Cossack. She ran
                  up turned around, came down on the rate of 20 miles an hour, ploughed through the
                  first bar, stopped, swung around aground again, Gen Reno was on the Patuxent, and
                  as he saw the Cossack go through, fairly danced. But feelings slightly changed
                  when she got [hard?] fast again. We went up to help the Scout out &amp; with the
                  help of the Pilot boy pulled her in to safer anchorage. Then we devilled around to
                  [?] Captain Bennet of the Patuxent's expression, and were put on board the Cossack
                  about half past twelve, in time for dinner. Bennet says he never saw such a tide -
                  when its high tide its low water, low tide high water - he'd be devilled if it
                  wasn't. Many of those on the Scout we had not seen since we embarked, and it was
                  comical to hear the mutual greetings of the men. So here we lie, high &amp; dry
                  again. With how much truth I cannot say, but Morris says it was the intention of
                  the Expedition to go to Yorktown. It is supposed that we will be embarked on
                  schooners and taken up to Roanoke Island. It is very dreary and monotonous staying
                  here, though this getting out and cruising around makes one feel better. I only
                  fear sickness breaking out among our men. Necessarily the ship is getting very
                  filthy. Half the ships are aground again, though this morning there a good many of
                  them afloat. Lt. Col. Potter &amp; Maj. Legendre of the N.Y. 51st came on to see
                  us this evening. We are still hard aground. I was up and with the Captain well it
                  appears that the man divorced from a former wife on account of some improper
                  conduct, and married a second time. This was made in favor of the second wife in
                  order to prevent any difficulty that might arise, if the legality of the divorce
                  was called in question. </p>

               <head>Tuesday 21st</head>
               <p>This was a still warmer day than yesterday. There was no winter in it. We were
                  again put on to the Patuxent, and with [?] we movved off a considerable way into
                  the channel but stuck just near were the Pioneer, which has part of the N.Y. 51st
                  on was fast. The Union and a black little gun boat were at her and directly we saw
                  her move - cheered her, and away she went into the channel, up into the Sound. She
                  is in anyhow, and if we but get past this wave we will go in too. The little
                  Patuxent tugs away, the Eagle comes to help us - but, it is now twelve o'clock,
                  the water is low, but we are in best of spirits that this evening we will go over,
                  or tomorrow at farthest. The schooner on which the signal corps sailed, has not
                  been heard from yet. Beaver feels rather good that he got sailing with us. Some
                  one that counted says that there are 110 vessels in here. We got back to the
                  Cossack in time for dinner.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Wednesay 22</head>
               <p>Last night about 8 o'clock, quite a little fleet came around us. Our old friend
                  Patuxent, the Union and two other tugs. We were all em- barked on the Union. There
                  was just room enough to stand between decks. 3 companies quartered in the upper
                  &amp; 3 in the lower packed in like [shad?] We dropped astern of the Cossack and
                  anchored. There was a lively time among the sailors getting the tugs lashed to, it
                  was dark, and the few lights [?] had seemed to make it darker yet. The channel
                  which was yesterday [?] with barrels, and flags, [?] now various colored lights,
                  red &amp; white. Our men were in fine spirits during the first three or four
                  hours. There was considerable singing, Campbell &amp; Smith of our company,
                  performing finely. Campbell has a peculiarly sweet voice, and his songs showed his
                  temperament delicate, refined - above the courser passions and tastes - and they
                  touched chords which were in every breast - Smith's was one about a miller, who
                  about to die, had an old mill and three sons; and called them each in, at his
                  deathbed to inquire how much toll they would take - &amp; left it to the eldest,
                  who would take three pecks or all. It was a quiet satire on millers. His other had
                  a delicate touch of smut - the charge for a guinea, and the tailor's wife - the
                  [?], some Butcher goes to Leicester to buy cattle - [?] the charms of some pretty
                  country wench and gives her a guinea - when he comes to pay the bill he tells the
                  Landlord that he gave the [?] maid a guinea &amp; got no change - the Landlord
                  calls the maid and she has to give up the guinea - a year afterwards the Butcher
                  returns again, and she places a child 3 months old on his knee - with some [?]
                  about the change for the guinea. The Tailor's wife has a frolic with a sailor, <pb
                     n="27"/> Tailor comes home suddenly, she puts him in a chest, sailor carries
                  off off his [chest?] the tailor in it - it is so heavy he opens it - finds tailor
                  &amp; carries him off sea, They are evidently "auld country" songs, handed down
                  among them - would [?] doubt have a trace of his descent, to look up how they got
                  them North Snyder sung "The Jolly brown jug" &amp; "Northhampton County Prison"
                  The latter is [his?] trial, Reeder, Judge Jones &amp; other local incidents. North
                  has been three times in the Penetentiary. He is a singular character, and very
                  wicked, vulgar, though he seems to have a good heart. So the time passed
                  pleasantly - gradually they became quiet &amp; sunk into disturbed slumber -
                  [piled?] and mixed in an indiscriminate manner. [?] &amp; I borrowed blankets of
                  the men and lay down on the gangway outside. We were there an hour or two - I
                  discovered symptoms of rain - &amp; went down by the furnace - where I had just
                  room enough to sit - by leaning [?] a little I dozed some - but my arms and legs
                  got paralyzed - &amp; could not change my position. Then it rained - a dozen or
                  more who were outside came crowding in crawled over us, down into the fire place -
                  then we dozed again - the rain ran in along the floor - I slipped off my blanket -
                  found my overcoat and [posterior?] all wet - the the [firemen?] had orders to get
                  up steam - then the dozen men, with knapsacks guns &amp; cartridge boxes, had to
                  crawl gack again over us. Capt Bell did some [funny?] swearing over it. Oh! it was
                  a dreary uncomfortable night. On comparing notes I found that none of the officers
                  or men had it any better than I had. About seven we steamed back to the Cossack
                  now happily beyond the channel, safely in the sound. That is a satisfaction that
                  makes up for all the discomfort of last night. Curtin came on board last night. He
                  &amp; Dr Gibson have been having pleasure excursions around ever since last
                  Friday. One of the unpleasant things that occur on board is the food and water of
                  the men. Yesterday the cooks went out to see the ship moving, and when they got
                  back, the soup was [burned?] a half inch crust on the bottom - the men threw the
                  stuff overboard. There had been detailed each day - the three got scared at the
                  fury of the men &amp; deserted the cook house, and it was impossible to find out
                  who they were. Then Lt. Goulen was put in charge, &amp; by evening coffee was made
                  - When it isknown that it takes two gallons of watera day - that it takes 3
                  barrels of water to make coffee once around - when it requires them to be cooking
                  day and night, how easily things may be thrown into disorder, and once so it takes
                  long to rectify - meanwhile 4 or 5 [?] men are suffering - growling - more [?] and
                  irritable because they have nothing all day long to engage their attention. To-day
                  they are out of water - they had coffee in the morning - but no water all day - a
                  thirst is intolerable - I felt it last night during the long night - The wind was
                  so high all day that we could not send any small boats for it, &amp; had to depend
                  on the tender mercies of a tug to come to relieve us. This evening it is blowing
                  furiously. But we have depth of water &amp; see room, and have no fears. [Down] it
                  was a constant source of anxiety - either aground or run into by other vessels,
                  all the time - not safe anchorage for ten vessels &amp; yet we had over a hundred
                  - blowing a gale all the time - Bennet the Pilot said he had not seen such weather
                  for [eighteen?] years.</p>

               <head>Thursday January 23.</head>
               <p>There came on a blow last night &amp; continued fearfully until this evening. The
                  waves were rolling high, and the weak stomachs got sick - and there were no
                  vessels came across the swash. We have been out of water for two days, a boat
                  started for some this morning in the storm - &amp; this evening a tug came
                  alongside &amp; put water on board. This is about all that happened. The storm
                  kept off all communication with us. We have a dead man - Geo Schaffer Co. [G?]. an
                  old man, who had been in the war of 1812 - never had been sick - I saw his box -
                  plain wooden [though] his name cut in and [tarred?] - [????] on it. The [?] them
                  on the sand beach, nothing [?] [mask?] them with a prospect of their being strewn
                  out or washed out. This evening the wind lulled - waves gone down, and stomachs
                  righted.</p>

               <p>Last night the storm burst down in fury and this forenoon it raged without
                  intermission. This afternoon it cleared again, but the sound is still very rough.
                  They took out the dead man and buried him on the <pb n="28"/>
                  <fw>Friday January 24.</fw> shore, with scarce room enough to do it. Those on
                  shore said it was the fiercest storm we had here. The companies made presents to
                  the seamen who went for water for them. I was made officer of the day and [?]
                  myself considerably getting a code of regulations made - which I supplied will be
                  effective for a few days, and then fall into discuse. It is the only objection I
                  have here is that there is not the energy to carry out effective discipline and
                  officers themselves somehow resist it. This now Friday - two days more it'll take
                  to bring the vessels across the swash - &amp; then we will have some active work,
                  I hope.</p>

               <head>Saturday Jan 25</head>
               <p>The day was clear and cool - the waves ran high. We are beginning to recognize old
                  comrades now across the swash. I saw the eagle beak of the Scout with my glass.
                  The Northerner and Admiral are lying together not our the the bar. We were
                  watching some firing from the Hunchback. The burst of flame and smoke long before
                  we heard the report - then the rushing noise - the explosion of the shell - a
                  cloud like a mans hand - in the air 3 or 4 miles from the ship - [again?] long
                  before the explosion heard. If one gun makes so much noise what will many make. I
                  was officer of the guard yesterday - the [Lts?] did not work well - &amp; was up
                  all night - &amp; felt delapidated most of the day - the brightness of the sun -
                  the rolling glittering waves &amp; sharp northern air made it unpleasant to be out
                  - it blinded me - Reading so much in this dark saloon has affected my eyes
                  somewhat. Last evening we had some warm bread, and this evening again - which
                  though tough was sweet, and delicious with some butter that [Rodarmel?] [raked?]
                  up somewhere &amp; I paid 50 cents a pound for it. The bodies of those two men
                  that died were lifted and taken up to the burying ground up at camp Winfield. I
                  should have gone up there, but have neglected until now it is too late. Getting
                  over and back has been no easy matter during the last three or four days - Some of
                  our boats had to be brought back by the steam tugs. We got into a fine discussion
                  as to card playing &amp; chess &amp; checkers - some contending that there was
                  chance in checkers as in eucher. - one that cards was chance which resulted in
                  some one producing a chess-board &amp; checkers - &amp; Shorkly Adjutant &amp;
                  Chaplain have indulged. Last night while going the rounds I found a card party in
                  every rat hole in the ship. They appeared to have runners out, so as to give
                  notice of my coming. It would sound like the scampering of rats when you go into a
                  cellar with a light, just getting glimpses of their retreating forms. One place in
                  the forecastle I wculd just see them going down a hole into the hold, and past
                  going round a bale of hay. I drafted instructions and regulations, and I suppose
                  everything will be back to the old state by the time my turn comes, &amp; I'll
                  have to take renewed curing, for getting up something new again.</p>

               <head>Sunday Jan. 26.</head>
               <p>This was such a bright bracing day - We had the long swell of the water, remaining
                  effect of the late storm - The waves danced gaily in the bright sunshine - the
                  wild geese and ducks sailed about in droves and the sea gulls gathered like snow
                  flakes over the dark green water. In the fresh morning breeze came the Admiral
                  over the sea - wash - Two of [Ward's?] 62 [?] [?] were brought from the wreck of
                  teh gun boat Zouave and put on the [fore-part?] of our boat. After dinner, Mr
                  [Glott?], Rodamel, Shorkley &amp; I got into the first cutter and sailed over to
                  the [Sutlers?] Schooner - the air was fresh enough to be bracing - the water rough
                  enough to give a bounding, exhilerating motion to the boat. We went down along the
                  channel, among the vessels so familiar to us, past the wrecked Zouave, under the
                  bow of the Scout - I thought I had made her out among the vessels over in the
                  sound - out into the farthest pockets, <pb n="29"/>
                  <fw>Sunday Jan 26. continued</fw> as the deep places of the harbor are called -
                  the harbor is full of schoals and deep places - the deeps places are called
                  pockets - It was near sunset when we left the Sutlers boat - we saw the Northerner
                  gaily steaming into the sound, cheered, as she passed, by those already there. It
                  really makes one feel good to see the difficulties at last overcome - there are
                  now 12 or 13 transports across - but the sun sank, as we [?] under a light wind,
                  back - leaving a horizon of orange and gold - gloriously resplendent. We got back
                  to the Cossack in time for tea - refreshed very considerably by our trip. There is
                  a brother of the [shoals?] gets the night-mare, almost every night, yells horribly
                  and wakens up every one in the saloon. Markley remarked quietly that he wished he
                  would ride that mare in the [daytime?] We coal tomorrow - I read a paper this
                  evening - the Baltimore American of Jan 23. It says "all that has been heard from
                  the Burnside expedition was a despatch from [?] Goldsboro that the town was full
                  of people flying from Newbern: also something taken from one of the Southern
                  papers - that one hundred of Burnside's fleet were seen on Pamlico sound - that
                  probably they would attack simultaneously Roanoke Island and Newbern - that they
                  were prepared for them in both places I think there are some thirty ships,
                  transports and gun boats now in the sound the balance are out in the inlet yet.
                  But we saw schooners come scudding in all sails set - [jibsail] - [staysail] -
                  [foresail] - [mainsail] - [main topsail] - fore-topsail] - I learned their names
                  from Mitchel the sailor who steered our boat -</p>

               <head>Monday January 27th</head>
               <p>This morning was pure and delightful - the sound waters were calm and placid - all
                  forenoon there was bjut the slightest ripple - We were on deck most of the morning
                  watching the gunboats practicing with their guns. Lt Col Bell came over from the
                  Scout - He told us that yesterday a small Rebel gunboat, bearing U.S. colors came
                  into the inlet and lay within a hundred yards of the Scout. One of our gun-boats
                  happening to go that way - she put up and off. That was real cute [They?] - much
                  to be admired. Another part of the mail of the other day came in but no letters
                  for me. Our life is so monotonous that slight things interest - &amp; it is
                  interesting to watch how at one time we gather in knots and how the conversation
                  floats from one topic to another, &amp; how the one group to another - Last night
                  - Sunday - in the fore part of the evening [Gib?] &amp; I talked of home and many
                  things that happened in our early lives - Shorkley Charley [Kline?] &amp; some
                  other one got talking of Muncy, got around to [?town] Shirleysburg - Then at that
                  town Capt Snyder floated in somehow - they got talking of stage coaches - that
                  reminded the Capt of a story of [?] who got into a coach, with a woman with a baby
                  - and [?] to put his hands in improper places - got his fingers daubed by
                  mistaking the baby's posterior, for something else, exclaiming Coachman, stop this
                  coach I am disgust - Then he told the story of a hair lipped fellow - which we
                  recognized as the story of Chas McGregor &amp; the cow - Blair floated in -
                  Shorkly &amp; I floated to bed - Blair wanted to know why we couldn't have roasted
                  potatoes for breakfast &amp; thought they might be roasted in the galleys of the
                  men. Other officers opposed interfering in anyway with the cook house of the men,
                  giving them a chance to growl - Interfere it won't interfere says Blair. "They
                  don't use those roasting places Who cares if they do talk if we really don't
                  interfere with them" but he [posts?] to ascertain. Capt [Shawl?] officer of the
                  guard, said he wished he had known Blair was going out he would have slipped out
                  and ordered the Guard to allow no one to enter. Re-enter Blair "The cooks say that
                  they will roast potatoes if they are taken out at five o'clock in the morning
                  John" to John Smith Col's servant &amp; head <pb n="30"/>

                  general for the officers mess, from his berth above. "There'll be no roasted
                  potatoes for breakfast in the morning. John" Blair, high tenor, "I was not saying
                  there would be Lt. Shorkley, only ascertaining whether potatoes would be roasted"
                  Blair 'high mad', and picks a quarrel with the adjutant, which was very comical at
                  the time, but has faded out of my memory. Morning. John sounds the gong - Shorkley
                  rises first: finds that the dog "general" has [cacapufied?] in front of my
                  [berth?] has been tramped around - &amp; his stockings are daubed - flings them
                  incontinently out - Mr Blair's light blue pants discovered lying on the floor -
                  Blair informed of danger, examines - finds the light blues daubed - By the time
                  all are up in that region &amp; the General receives a liberal cursing and sundry
                  threats. Meanwhile Capt. Shawl is dressings is annoyed by our remarks - General is
                  caught by the neck and summarily ejected - conversation and [objurgation continues
                  until breakfast. Shorkley passes some severe remark about dogs in general &amp;
                  the general in particular - Capt. Shawl unable to justify, [espouses?] the roast
                  potatoes [aside?] and sayd he'd rather have roast potatoes than that tough biscuit
                  But Blair ain't on that side now - he's adverse on the dog question. Blair comes
                  to the second table - &amp; the dog question absorbs his attention - the only
                  sharp remark amid all the filth, was that the dog would have to die a soldier's
                  death if caught again, &amp; if he would have only staid on his own side ([id
                  est?] the side the Shawl berth was on) "but a dog always hunts a clean place."
                  Blair appears in dark blue. The roast potatoes appeared at dinner - It is remarked
                  that Blair, usually very talkative wherever he is, is silent. Now we get an
                  explanation of how so many of our towels have disappeared. Every one complains of
                  having lost towels, one two or three. We thought some one must be laying in a
                  stock - but we are told that during the days of the sickness, the General was sick
                  too - he wawsn't particular where he put his accounts [cast up?] - on the sofas,
                  on the carpet, and elsewhere - most generally inconvenient for the rest of us -
                  &amp; the servant that cleaned them up generally seized on one of our towells,
                  wiped it up &amp; cast it into the sea - So it is with the general as with the
                  rest of us - when once the general attention of the community is drawn to a
                  criminal all faults, crimes and misfortunes are fished up. I tremble for the
                  general if he commits any other bad deed. His faults are not his faults - but is
                  rather his misfortune. There thats a dirty sheet - but one can't give a full
                  description of our life without mentioning such incidents. Some two weeks ago I
                  threw out my chewing tobacco - Thursday I quit smoking until I can get on </p>

                  the signal corps embarked. Lt Reed of that corps came on board this evening. He
                  said the fog that came on us in the Chesapeake, closed on them before they left
                  Annapolis. The were anchored at Fortress Monroe during the storm - came opposite
                  Hateras Inlet last Wednesday - the storm of Thursday drove them out to sea, and
                  took them clear across the gulf stream - they got back last night. Rodarmel told
                  me [Saml?] Wilson was a Lt in a Cavalry Company in Corman's Regiment. We had

               <head>Wednesday Jan. 29. 1862</head>
               <p>This was a delicious day. One felt like lying out on the sunny side of the deck
                  &amp; enjoying the [?] - the air was so pure - but they told me the barometer was
                  sinking, &amp; I have pains in my bones this evening. I was out on deck until ten
                  o'clock just lazily enjoying myself. Then I looked over [Lossings?] pictorial
                  history of the U.S. I think that is a most admirable book. About twelve a
                  suspicious sail was in sight and a gun boat started in pursuit. We watched them as
                  they sped away, until both faded from sight and the reach of our glasses. The gun
                  boat returned toward sunset, but I have not learned the result. I only saw that
                  she had nothing in tow. A coal schooner came along side, and they commenced
                  putting on coal. The Pawtuxent came up with the four companies from the Scout, and
                  crowded them on our boat. I understand that the Scout is to be brought across in
                  the morning - she and the Rue - which has our camp equipage on board and to be
                  taken in tow by our ship. I was on board the coal schooner - one of the [?] told
                  me that along the Southern shore there are a great many dead bodies [in bodies?]
                  washed out: lying along the Beach. Supposed to be those that were killed when
                  Hateras was taken, buried at low tide and since washed out. He said he had heard
                  that there were 240 killed. About sunset the Spaulding came across the swash - [?]
                  every ship load - the band of the 24th Mass playing hail to the chief, and Dixie.
                  We gave her a cheer as she let go her anchor among us. This was the ship that ran
                  regular trips between Fortress Monroe, Hateras, Port Royal. She is a very fine
                  steamer. Gen Burnside took her, made her his headquarters, substituted another
                  steamer, I think the Eastern State. It was said that when she came across the
                  swash, the expedition would sail. I got a "World" of the 22nd from the Sutters
                  Schooner. There were some conjectures about our Expedition. Roanoke, Washington
                  and New berne were mentioned as points of attack, and that 50,000 men had probably
                  been sent from the army of the Potomac to strengthen these points. Clearly North
                  Carolina will be the theatre of war very soon. To take Roanoke, occupy New bern,
                  and hold it as a point at [?] to make way for an army to to go goldsoro - The army
                  of the Potomac must then retrograde &amp; when that is done their cause is done.
                  Tom Grier and Harry House came on board this afternoon: both looking fat and
                  hearty. They were both very sea-sick - Tom, as expected, made friends with every
                  one, and has a button from each State Regiment sewed on his overcoat.</p>

               <head>Thursday 30.</head>
               <p>There came on a pretty severe blow during the forenoon, the wind blowing one way
                  and the tide coming counter, made a rough sea - the waves were white capped, and
                  the number of sea-gulls attracted by the floating waifs of food - the lowring sky
                  made it a beautiful storm scene. We are all still crowded on board - something
                  over a thousand souls - The ship is badly ventilated - dirty - hardly standing
                  room and it stinks like a pig-pen. It makes me more and more uneasy everyday. A
                  schooner came along side with water this evening. If the Scout would make his
                  appearance. I had a long letter with [Cleat?] the Tribune Reporter. The substance
                  of the information is that there are but two regular officers, outside the three
                  Generals, among all the staff. Most of them are club men of New York, wealthy men
                  - civilians - dont understand anything of military detail - not accustomed to any
                  self-reliant exertion - and this accounts for the inefficient management, or
                  rather execution of things. Besde that the tugs did not arrive until to-day. We
                  are to go to Roanoke - the battle will be fought principally by gunboats - landed
                  - expedition reorganized and boats reassigned. The New Brunswick makes her
                  appearance across the swash, and the tugs arriving give us new hope of sailing
                  soon. The chase yesterday turned out to have a steamer, schooner rigged. They were
                  not able to overtake her.</p>

               <p>The wind blew pretty hard all day, and this evening set in with storm and rain.
                  This morning we saw a little schooner standing in toward us, running hard before
                  the stiff nor-wester, steered like a hog, the sailors said, badley steered. One of
                  our gun boats ran out to her, she dropped sail and was towed in. it had on board 2

                  stationed there - they said it was reported that there were ten thousand at
                  Roanoke Island and that we had 30,000 We received our mail this afternoon about a

               <p>The name of that little scr. that came in was John Benjamin Washington. It is
                  between 20 &amp; 30 feet long, and 8 or ten wide. The names of those on it were
                  Trail Stubs, Peter Mc W. Davis, Thoms. Blay. Thomas Bulger, Lewis Longereau.
                  Except Davis were all Northerners. They belonged to the Beaufort County Plow boys
                  of the 7th Reg N.C. State Troops. Commanded by Maj. Hall, and were stationed at
                  Middleton in Hyde Co, 25 miles S.W. from here. They were at roll call the previous

                  bread &amp; pork - no tea or coffee - tea made from the[?] Tree whose leaves were
                  worth $9 per bushel - rec'd no pay - gov N.C. issued a proclamation &amp; men were
                  drafted, when he heard of the fleet that it was Maj. Hall made the reconaisance -
                  came back ordered up two more companies - had them about 800 men &amp; he could
                  whip 4000 yankees with them. Last night it rained and we had a very disagreeable
                  time on board. The ship had not been policed for several days, ever since the
                  companies from the Scout came on board. The rain drove them in from the decks,
                  &amp; they were lying thick all over the boat - in the dirt and filth - every
                  available foot was covered. Then to make things worse, the Surgeon, Capt Snyder,
                  and several other officers having been off the boat and came back drunk, about one
                  o'clock pulled the Reporter Bently out of bed, and they tramped all over the boat,
                  through our cabin and among the men in the gangways. Capt Snyder very tight in the
                  morning and the Surgeon evidently feeling stumpy &amp; [steaming?] it. The Scout
                  came along side about ten o'clock and the four companies put on her &amp; she
                  dropped astern. Shorkly came to me and told me that Santo who has been sick
                  several days had the small-pox, evidently, judgeing from symptoms, though the
                  surgeons said it was chicken pox. I felt dreadfully for a little while - no sense
                  of personal fear, as I do not feel afraid of it, but I felt sick at heart to think
                  that had broken out among us. Crowded as we were, and lying here unable to move
                  him it could not but spread rapidly. The thought of our regiment being prostrated
                  with it was horrible. I went to Dr Noble however, and he assured me that it was
                  chicken pox - and that the reason why it was so hard on him was he was thick and
                  dark skinned. We now dine at four o clock and have no supper. We relish our meals
                  much more, as with three meals a day we had no time to get hungry. [Alcott?] told
                  me that D'Epineuil raised his money by the sale of commissions - would kick up a
                  fuss with some captain or other officer, kick him out and re-sell the commission.
                  That Regiment has gone back to Fortress Monroe. The Lt Col Monteil is here some
                  place. He had been ordered to rejoin his Regiment, &amp; after it was order- ed
                  back he was directed to stay here. He is, I believe, an experienced artillery
                  officer. It cleared of beautifully this evening, but the barometer indicated a
                  blow, the Captain told me. </p>

                  two meals for several days - breakfast at nine o'clock and dinner at four. The day
                  was observed in the fleet. There was no work done, except this evening there were
                  one or two schooners brought up. We had a chance to send letters to-day as we
                  understand there is a mail to leave tomorrow. I wrote one letter to the Chronicle
                  and one yesterday to John. Everything appears to be ready. I heard that Burnside
                  said he would not move on a Friday or Sunday: on the first because of the
                  superstition connected with it, on the latter because it was not right. There are
                  5 or so little tugs - very small - named, Lioness Champion, Tempest the smallest
                  of all - and they look so bold and brave. rushing around.</p>

               <p>This Morning early it drizzled, but then cleared cold cloudy . This afternoon sun
                  came out, very windy, and [sitck] behind a bank of clouds. Capt Renaut promised a
                  clear day for tomorrow. [Landsnun] prophecie a storm. It is said that the little
                  boat had three rebel spies. They came near in the fog, the fog suddenly cleared
                  away and they hadn’t time to get off : that another boat had the contrabands.
                  There was [Auff] dog, and it sat heavy on my stomach. The inconvenience of so many
                  of us being here together is exemplified in many ways. One can regard the illness
                  of a [news] of a small family with charity — but when there are thirty or forty,
                  of varied and not all ways pleasant habits, some sick with different diseases, the
                  consumption spreading around, those subject to sick headache puking around — pigs
                  overloading their stomachs, and making themselves disagreeable — oh, for our
                  canvas home and quiet gentlemanly mess. A day passes very quick. Breakfast a nine
                  — a few hours reading brings dinner at four — we then go on deck to watch the
                  sunset, or take a constitutional. The evenings seem the longest however. It seems
                  a long while until nine o’clock . Morris came on board this evening with sailing
                  orders — to got at 7 o’clock in the morning — but its terms and effect I did not
                  learn further. Morris had been used to talking to Neill, who has caught cold and
                  is very deaf, and he bellowed at us as if we were deaf.</p>

               <head>Wednesday Feb 5</head>
               <p>It was bright and clear this morning and cold , continued so all day. The first
                  brigade got under way about eight o’clock, and the second Brigade about nine
                  o’clock. The Northerner first, with three schooners in tow, George Peabody with
                  two schooners, and next the Cossack, with the Scout in tow. We watched with
                  interest the Commodore lead out past the point followed by the gun boats, and when
                  it headed Northward we felt assured our destination was Roanoke Island. It was a
                  beautiful sight to see the fleet steaming slowly up the sound, the waters
                  sparkling in the brilliant sunshine. The air cold and clear. So they continued all
                  day long, making scarcely more than three miles an hour. We dined at four o’clock
                  and went on deck, as usual to watch the sunset. Stumpy point was in eight. A low
                  range of trees marked the marshy shore to the left, and over it down back of us,
                  the splendid arch that crowned the sun as he sank down, was as fine as any I ever
                  saw. The red had not yet left the sky, before we came opposite Stumpy point. The
                  American flag run up the foremast of the Patuxeut, our anchor dropped, and we left
                  the deck. Not before we saw the gunboats range themselves as usual out beyond us,
                  our bulwark and safety. The Scout came floating up along side, our comrades of
                  that ilk were gathered on the sides and shrouds, as we were gathered on the side
                  next them, and a lively conversation ensued, Scout. “Bring back those hams you
                  stole” Cossack. “Where are the hospital towels. Scout. You can sleep on the
                  hurricane deck if you come over here.” Cossack. Where’s the quartermaster’s
                  whiskey.” Scout we can accommodate you in the dirty gangways, as you did us.”
                  Cossack you weren’t fit to sleep any place else.” &amp; so it went on with banter
                  and test. The allusions were to the fact that when the Scouters came on board here
                  the other day and during their stay forty five dollars worth of ham, belonging to
                  the officer of the Scouters was stolen as also beef tongue &amp;c. And our
                  hospital stores were broken open and fifteen towels taken, and a barrel of whiskey
                  belonging to Uncle Sam. Tapped. Money was also stolen. We were unable to tell
                  whose crew did it but in a bantering way each accused the other of it: Each
                  alledging that there was no thieving in either vessel until they all got together
                  on board the Cossack. Frank [Rizetdly], artist for the Lon Illust news, a
                  correspondent of Lon Times, and Frank Leslies artist are on board the Spaulding. I
                  heard of Frank [Rizetdly] being at Centreville but did not see him. I should like
                  to see him, because I commenced taking the Lon Illust News first at the beginning
                  of the Italian war &amp; he illustrated that and afterwards the Sicilians war</p>

               <head>Thursday Feb 6 </head>
               <p>We moved farther up the Sound - very slowly - stopped about ten o'clock, and
                  anchored about eleven. It began to rain became misty, and rained until evening,
                  and then cleared off about six o'clock. When the anchor was let go, the boatswain
                  gave a long whistle, and called down the hatchway "All hands splice the main
                  brace" I watched &amp; wondered what that meant, but was soon edified on seeing
                  the grog served out all around. The other evening a boatswain came on board and
                  now everything is done by the whistle. The whole batch of reporters left this
                  evening.They evidently got the idea that their advantages were not so great here
                  for obtaining information. They were as jealous of each other as tom-cats, and
                  every day or two raised a row with the Captain because he, or they supposed he
                  showed favour to one more than the other, &amp; then they would have a convention
                  - so that one wouldn't take advantage of the other. They were mad because they
                  supposed the officers were corresponding for his dirty little country newspapers.
                  Alcot, Ripley and Prawe asked the Capt. for a boat to go to the Spaulding - then
                  all wanted to go. Capt. said but 3 could go at one time. When Alcot got over he
                  sends a noteback to the Col. that it was with difficulty they were allowed to
                  stay, and that they would have no sleeping accomodations. This was evidently to
                  deter the Herald &amp; Inquirer. But as the Col. was not interested, he did not
                  impart the information and they all departed. Burnside will curse the day they
                  were allowed to come along, and the sooner they are sent off the better. We
                  Pennsylvanians needn't expect anything from them - Even Alcot, not disposed toward
                  us, seemed sort of mad because our Regiment was assigned the left of the Brigade.
                  Roanoke Island is in sight of us - a little blue streak on the horizon. We can see
                  a light house too. We can't tell what has been done today, further than that the
                  troops of the Pioneer and Lancer have been put on other boats, and they, the
                  boats, taken forward. They are gun boats and each have four guns. </p>
            </div>

               <head>Friday Feb 7 </head>
               <p>This morning it was clearer but rather cold. The gun boats has moved up into the
                  Channel between Roanoke Island and the Tyrell shore. We kept moving up slowly too
                  - the fleet passed a bend at the point of the island, and we could see them across
                  the point of the shore. This took all the morning and we were eager spectators of
                  the scene, until about half past eleven the gun boats opened on the batteries.
                  Then commenced an awful cannonade. We watched the shells bursting in every
                  direction, some high in mid air some low close to the ships, and our shells
                  striking in every direction about the battery. A black smoke enveloped the battery
                  - and the flames burst out - their barracks were on fire - twice they put them out
                  and a third time they caught. We recognized the different boats - we especially
                  admired a little sloop with one gun, which sailed like a duck up and down
                  delivering her fire with emphasis. The Cossack ran up within perhaps four miles
                  &amp; we had a beautiful and uninterrupted view of the my crossed our bow full,
                  and drawing behind her about 30 surf boats filled with men. They stood over to our
                  right. Just before this the Patuxent passed up with Reno on board - we cheered
                  him. I got up on the hog-frame and waved my hat to Tom Grier, whom I saw on the
                  hurricane deck. When the boats had got off to the right they laid there - about
                  five o'clock the signal for disembarking was given. The Scout had been lashed
                  along side of the Cossack during the afternoon. Lt. Col Bell in attempting to
                  cross from the Scout fell down between the boats. Fortunately the wheels were not
                  going, and he climbed up the paddles and came out the door of the wheel house.

               <fw>Friday 7.</fw>
               <p>Our boats had already been lowered. The two surf boats were to be towed by the
                  small ones. Then Capt Bennet &amp; his little boy got into the small boat. The
                  color guard, I noticed Peter Kozier, color corporal from our company among them,
                  got into the boats and as many of Co. B. Capt Bell, as could got on board and put
                  off. Co. A. Capt Bolton put off from the Scout. Soon Croatan Sound was full of
                  little black specks moving toward the shore. I think there must have near five
                  thousand men moved at once. There were a few houses standing on the shore, and we
                  observed a company of rebels there but they ran as ours landed. We watched the
                  first color planted on the shore and its black surrounding of men, then a second.
                  It was now nearly dusk. The firing of the gunboats and battery had nearly ceased.
                  One of the little black gunboats came near us - we observed his stern somewhat
                  decomposed. On inquiring he said one of his steel guns burst and killed one man
                  and wounded several others. We saw the Hunchback draw off with her and knocked
                  out. The Delware covered the landing of the troops and the other gun boats formed
                  in a line toward shore between the battery and the place of landing. We went below
                  - coffee hot and smoking, warm bread and ham on the table, we thought to have a
                  stomach full before we went. But the Deleware ran along side, and we were ordered
                  off immediately - had hardly time to pour the scalding fluid down. It was now
                  night - the moon struggling with fitful effort through the dark banks of clouds.
                  The 8 companies were put on board and we left the Cossack. When the steamer was
                  about a hundred yards from shore, a boat at the stern disembarked part of Co H
                  with myself and we made the shore. I formed them and sent Dave Brewer up ahead to
                  pick out the way. It was very dark and the ground boggy, so that it shook under
                  our feet. Brewer had gone but a few yards when he suddenly disappeared, &amp; I
                  saw him bobbing up on the other side of a ditch "look out Captain heres a well" We
                  passed it safely, and got abreast the bow of the boat where I waited and formed
                  the whole company with a few missing who turned up afterwards however. Then we had
                  to travel through a swamp - a road had been formed of saplings but they were
                  scattered and we often went in over boot top. We got on to terra firma pretty
                  soon, and met Beaver, who was acting as an aid to the Col. who piloted us up to
                  our place in the Regiment. We stacked arms, placed sentinels over the stacks, I
                  cautioned the men about an alarm, that they should rise and take their places
                  behind the stacks, and await orders to take arms. Then they dispersed to hunt wood
                  &amp; bedding, cornstalks, brush &amp;c. There was a house and some outbuildings
                  and fences. These latter were soon demolished to make fire wood, &amp; an
                  apparently well fence clearing of about 8 acres was soon as open as any common. I
                  got several split sticks &amp; Shorkly &amp; I lay down on them. He had a gum
                  parachute &amp; I a small gum blanket. Beaver had nothing but a blue overcoat,
                  which we had all put on one of each before we started. We lay an hour or two. It
                  began to rain. Beaver got off to the porch of a house and shivered under a canvass
                  tent. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
               <head> Saturday 8. </head>
               <p>It rained incessantly all night and there was no sleep. We sat by a miserable
                  little fire all night. Some times I dozed and dreamed of being in the comfortable
                  cabin of of the Cossack, to wake with a start to find myself miserably cold and
                  wet. So all passed the night. I don't know, but I think I suffered more than ever
                  I did. Towards morning, perhaps between five and six, we all went over to the
                  porch of the house, Shorkley, Beaver &amp; I, and though it was crowded, I sat
                  down &amp; took a few winks of sleep. A few shots were fired, &amp; every body
                  ran. We got back to our company and found them quietly standing behind their
                  stacks, ready to take arms. We took arms, dressed, &amp; stood sometime, the alarm
                  passed, I formed the men according to their numbers, we could not do it last
                  night, divided them into platoons &amp; sections, and we stood in the drizzling
                  rain. The different regiments formed, some had lapped with us in the darkness of
                  the night. There were perhaps two thousand men there. Our regiment came out with
                  over 800 men, My company 73. The first Brigade started about seven o'clock. Reno,
                  Burnside were about. Morris came across to us with a great big sword with a steel
                  scabbard buckled on him. None of the officers had their horses. "You'll soon have
                  orders to march are you ready". "Yes". We teased Morris about his big sword he
                  could scarcely draw it &amp; return it, it was so long. I saw Lt. Col Monteil
                  cross the field to the house, the first time I had seen him since I sat as judge
                  advocate </p>

            <pb n="36"/>

               <fw>Saturday continued. </fw>
               <p>about up past seven we heard some shots and then a volley of musketry. Foster was
                  driving in the pickets. Then bang went the artillery then musketry and so it kept
                  up. We moved up - the head of our brigade had already entered the wood, and our
                  reg. still standing in the clear, when the first wounded man was carried along -
                  then another and another - it was the most trying thing we had to endure. But the
                  officers were all cool and calm, and every command was given in a clear voice,
                  &amp; it seemed to keep the courage up. We passed up a narrow road through the
                  wood, just wide as a wagon track, like our mountain roads, thickets of low pines
                  and bushes. It was just like the roads up around Rengler’s' old mill - Then it was
                  thick with wounded men carried and limping past us. Double quick - came to a mud
                  puddle we were dainty at the first &amp; got around it, which broke us up a
                  little, but the next one we dashed through. An occasional shell and bullet
                  whistled, but we could see nothing but the regiment winding through the wood ahead
                  - we turned off through the wood at a double quick, and got into another road -
                  the battle we could hear, raged fiercely - every step we met wounded and dying and
                  exhausted and some to whom we strongly suspected of being prematurely exhausted.
                  An officer came and told me to send word to my Col. to send a company of
                  skirmishers out to the right. I thought of aids &amp; officers giving orders
                  without authority, but still determined to obey orders, and sent up Sergt Etwine
                  with the order - The Col afterwards told me that some company at the head,
                  relieved him of that agreeing to deploy. We passed the hospital which was so near
                  that several men who carried the wounded there were killed. Zing goes a shell over
                  our heads, and a piece struck a man lying down to rest &amp; killed him. We came
                  to a halt - our regiment had turned to the left by order, but could not get
                  through. My company was just at the point where we had turned from the road. The
                  Col sent word forward that he couldn't advance on the left. The Rhode Island regt
                  came through the wood and passed by the head of my co. up the road. I stood with
                  the Col on a log at the fork of the roads when a volley of musketry passed over
                  our heads accompanied with a shell. We got down rather suddenly. Here the bullets
                  sung unpleasantly near. Orders came for us to leave so much of our Regt. as had
                  passed the fork of the road and turn of the rest to the right up the road - There,
                  thinks I, I am to lead the column. Everything was so uncertain, did not know where
                  the enemy were, musketry sounded all over - all around - it was wood and brush
                  &amp; nobody to be seen - we soon saw things however with more than the eye of
                  faith. Co D Second company ahead of me was turned off leaving two companies and
                  Lt. Col Bell in the thicket on the left - Double quick up, up we go - balls, shell
                  flying somewhere - I saw Gen Reno at the corner of the wood - John Morris, then
                  our brass field pieces, then all our other regiments lying flat down then an
                  opening two or three hundred yards broad, then the battery of the enemy, the
                  belching fire and smoke, the pail report of rattle of balls all around and above
                  us- wanging into the trees - here we came into a swamp up to our knees in mud
                  &amp; deeper - a poor fellow lie all doubled up beside a felled pine tree, we
                  tramp on over him - we were in front of the enemies battery, in full view,
                  crossing to gain their right - the swamp was tangled so that the regiment halted
                  and we lay down right in front of the battery. The swamp was just like pine swamp
                  - I've been in both and this was worse. Up again to run the gauntlet. We lay there
                  some ten or twenty minutes flat on the ground. We gained the right and went
                  plunging through the swamp up to our waists. Beaver was standing on a stump
                  collecting the different companies - I never saw more than a half dozen of my
                  company. I was standing on a stump looking ahead, when I saw Shorkley about ten
                  yards ahead plunging through calling co. H. It bewildered me to see him there, I
                  wondered how the rear of my company could have got there. Billy Allison, Brewer,
                  Sergt Campbell &amp; Charles Merrill were with me generally and others who
                  appeared and disappeared I rushed ahead and found that Shorkley had but two or
                  three with him. He had cut across and got ahead of our colors - we still dispute
                  how it happened, he alledging that I followed the Rhode Island colors. That
                  couldn't be as the The Rhode Islanders were still further to our right. However
                  Beaver appeared on a stump and he was calling to co. H away to the right to come
                  over to the capt - We were certainly ahead of our colors, for they came up
                  afterwards, part of our company having followed it. Here we halted and got
                  collected. The Rhode Islanders on our right parallel. Here we heard a cheer. The
                  back companies of our Regt were still in front of the battery, we all took it up
                  and cheered when they told us our colors were planted on the enemy battery. <pb
                     n="37"/> Just before it however, we saw a man on a tree making signals. one
                  from our regiment stepped out without orders. the man disappeared. Charles Merrill
                  was with me though and he kept on talking in his usual quiet way. He said he had
                  been in pine swamp, but this was worse. He had been hardly able to do any service
                  since he has been here, but he was one of the most quiet cheerful soldiers I ever
                  saw &amp; he walked along waded rather, with his musket on his shoulder canteen
                  and haversack just as if he were in the court room walking round the bar. We
                  pushed on - the Rhode Island and ours got mixed. We came out on the right and the
                  front of the battery Here we had to wade a pond up to our middle - but there was
                  the battery. The right wing of our regt drawn up were marching on. We had to halt
                  to form and it was near an hour before it put out and formed. By this time all the
                  troops had left, and our battalion was ordered to remain at first to draw the
                  guns, &amp; then to stay in the battery. I chafed at this - However while forming
                  I left the company to go to the battery. Here I met Mr Mallory &amp; he shook
                  hands congratulating our safe delivery. I remember saluting him just as we left
                  our bivouac ground in the morning as we marched fast to go to the wood, and his
                  face said "he might not see us again in life." We lost but two or three. I went on
                  to the road on the left of the battery - just at the corner lay a dead man - and
                  on the right just by the gun of the embrasure a handsome dark skinned man, black
                  whiskers and mustache &amp; hair I noticed his delicate hands and small feet - he
                  lay on his back his eye staring wide open, handsome even in his miserable
                  surroundings - half imbedded in mud - hands blackened with powder - no uniform -
                  had a pea jacket, and fine underclothes - with "Seldon" written on his undershirt
                  and waistband of his drawers I learned afterward he was Lt. Seldon, son of Dr
                  Seldon of Norfolk - that Col. Shaw cautioned him against exposing himself - "Damn
                  them they can't hit me" he scarcely said it when he fell pierced through below the
                  eye. At the centre gun lay a mule still in harness probably to draw off the gun -
                  looked, very much, like as if it had its throat cut - but Col Jordan of the Rebels
                  said it was killed by a mine-ball. Farther over lay a muscular man, with large red
                  whiskers - a ball had struck him in the back of the head and his brain had oozed
                  out into his hat until it was full. There were five or six dead men lay in the
                  fort. A wall tent was pitched on the left. Two wounded rebel officers were laying
                  there. Lt. Col. Patter who entered the fort from the left said that when a few of
                  our men approached one of the them he cut at them with his sword, and on his
                  asking him why, he did so, he said he had heard that we were ordered to give no
                  quarter. If officers believed that, what should their men believe. We afterwards
                  learned that they thought so, I had been told to by their officers. The most
                  disagreeable thing was to see that the dead had been all robbed - pockets turned
                  inside out - buttons cut off for relics. I was attracted to look at Seldon again,
                  &amp; found his name had been cut out in both places. I walked around through the
                  swamp &amp; dead bodies were lying scattered around through it. We had dragged one
                  of the cannon some distance, when Burnside ordered them back, and the balance of
                  our regiment were ordered to stay in the fort. Owing to the constant wet weather
                  and exposure with no coffee or cooking utensils, all we had to eat was in our
                  haversacks, Reno had ordered up whiskey. The officer in charge passed us, and
                  wished Shawl to send a party in charge of a commissioned officer to bring some
                  back to our men, as he would not deal it out until he reached head quarters Lt.
                  Foster &amp; I were sent with ten men &amp; we followed up the grog for a couple
                  of miles when we met Beaver <pb n="38"/>
                  <fw>Saturday 8th </fw> who was on with the advance, and had been sent back to
                  order up the rest. I told him that we had been ordered to remain. He started back
                  with us. We came to a crossroad, which he said was the road they went, but the
                  officer in charge was perverse &amp; went straight on - we followed him &amp;
                  Beaver left us. Up to the right was a house where Capt C. Jennings Wise lay
                  mortally wounded with five wounds. A gentleman had picked up his gum blanket at
                  the battle field &amp; I saw his name on it. The road was strewed with knapsacks,
                  and other things thrown away. I met Gen. Foster on horseback - “Well” says he
                  “boys we have gained a great victory - they have just surrendered to me two or
                  three thousand, and the island is ours.” We threw up our caps and yelled. We came
                  to a field - An old man and young man Islanders half drunk were explaining to us
                  how they had been loyal men all the time. Then we travelled on - every one we met
                  told us it was a couple of miles - We were dreadfully tired . We let the grog gang
                  go, anxious to get some quarters as it was growing dark. Lost our road several
                  times - at last after dark arrived in what seemed a little town, but was the
                  enemy’s barracks. I stumbled into Col Upton, Mass 25th and asked permission to
                  sleep on the floor. I pulled off my boots. There was an inch of water in them
                  &amp; we had travelled 7 or 8 miles since we left the battle ground, &amp; I was
                  rather sore . It was a grateful thing to lie on the cabin floor. Col Russel of the
                  10th Conn was killed in the battle from concussion it is supposed of a passing
                  cannon ball as there was no mark on him. One near him said he just doubled himself
                  together and fell dead. We passed him on our way to the battle field. One of his
                  men carrying him, crying called to us to give it to them, they had killed his Col.
                  Capt Henry was killed too. He talked awhile complaining of pain in his stomach,
                  but there was nothing, but a blue streak across his stomach. Lt. Col Monteil was
                  also killed, he unnecessarily exposed himself, firing with his rifle in front of
                  the battle, Frank Leslie’s artist was in close, behind a stump.</p>

               <head>Sunday 9th </head>
               <p>I woke up this morning feeling as if I had been made for an old man eighty years
                  old . My boots were scarcely dry, but fortunately the Chaplain of the 21st had
                  found a can of lard and by a dint of greasing, and halling I got them on. I found
                  outside quite a little town. Cabins nicely built in streets for the men &amp; log
                  houses for the officers in the order of a regular camp. I saw a great many of the
                  rebel prisoners - among them the Richmond Light infantry blues, Capt Wise’s
                  company, which had so handsomely, entertained the New York 7th. They were fine
                  aristocrat looking fellows in grey uniform like the Lewisburg greys. I found I was
                  but two of three hundred yards from Reno’s quarters through the wood. It was a
                  handsomer set of barracks than the others - the houses built of boards - the
                  chimneys outside of mud and sticks plastered with mud. I found Beaver in the Col’s
                  quarters &amp; the Col told me I need not go back as he had ordered the other
                  companies to come up. During the forenoon I went down to see the forts - there
                  were three - one of eleven one of four, the other of ten - this last one was the
                  one that was bombarded but it had not been materially injured at all. They had
                  spiked the guns, cut the ropes, threw most of the ammunition into the swamp. They
                  are beautiful works built of sod and sand - and heavily armed with thirty two
                  pounders some rifled - they are very formidable, &amp; well manned could not well
                  be taken. </p>

               <fw>Sunday 9th </fw>
               <p>The batteries, numbering three, are very nicely constructed of sod and sand. The
                  fort just below here on the beach was called, Huger, now Reno, eleven guns next
                  Blanchard, now Park, four guns mounted and a place for a fifth, lying on the shore
                  at the landing - the third on Pig point, Bartow, now Fort Foster. This latter was
                  not injured any of account. There were two red guns - one or two disabled. The
                  barracks inside were burned and a great many arms destroyed. Houses outside were
                  perforated with shot &amp; shell and we saw many lying far back of it. A great
                  deal of powder had been thrown into the swamp, and are in case number of arms have
                  been fished out of the swamps. On our way back, we met a party who had taken two
                  prisoners. One a bright eyed fellow said he was from Craven County &amp; that his
                  company had worked the guns themselves. The fourth shot had disabled the gun, and
                  one man killed &amp; three wounded was all the casualties. Hassenplug found an old
                  classmate of his when at Union College, Piot by name, from Murfreesboro' capt of a
                  company. He knew John Blair Linn. They had long conversations of old times. He
                  told us a great deal, which we did not altogether. I suppose they placed the same
                  reliance on a great many of our statements. He said the army at Norfolk was 15.000
                  that was on the Island on Saturday during the battle, and was so hard pressed that
                  he left his overcoat. We heard the explosion of the fortification on Nags head on
                  Saturday evening, but took it for an evening gun from a nine inch shell gun.
                  Beaver picked up a tract “for the times” published at Petersburg Va. He has also
                  one he took out of the cap of one that was shot in the last skirmish just before
                  the the surrender near this camp. Casting our burden on the Lord by Joseph
                  Atkinson. “There is no class of men who excite a deeper interest in every loyal
                  son of the south than our gallant soldiers &amp; who have exposed them selves in
                  defense of our honor our liberties &amp; our lives" The Col sent for the rest of
                  our battalion &amp; our company arrived in the evening. They passed a most
                  miserably wretched night, and said they felt very anxious about me. The barracks
                  put up here will probably accommodate four regiments. There is every thing
                  indicating an eye to comfort convenience and a permanent stay. </p>

               <head>Monday 10 </head>
               <p>It commenced snowing, and on the whole was a very disagreeable day. This after
                  noon or evening I started to go on board the Cossack, I went with Lt Blair, Brown
                  &amp; Conolly seamen, &amp; a half dozen others. It rained and grew dark on us
                  before our weary tramp of five or six miles through the sand ended at the Pig
                  point battery. As the cook pointed out where our boat lay, visions of hot coffee
                  and warm biscuit rose before me - decent coffee we had not since we left the
                  Cossack - &amp; that was nothing like Dick can make. Our vexation can be imagined
                  faintly when we found the boat gone - we were five miles from our camp and it
                  would take two hours to make it - it was snowing. We made various attempts to get
                  over - we started to get quarters. Our clothes were wet we had no blankets - We
                  found a little house whose whole front had been knocked out with a shell - built a
                  fire with about a half cord of wood at a time and got just inside the house. Oh,
                  but it was miserable It was the longest night I had yet spent, of all the
                  miserable nights I had spent since I left the Cossack. About eleven o’clock we
                  were roused with the news brought there, to the headquarters, we were not aware
                  they were in a shanty close by that the gunboats had run past the fortification at
                  Elizabeth City, slap against the gunboats boarded them set fire to &amp; burned
                  five, the Jamy among the number, captured one, then turned their attention the
                  fort, landed, spiked the guns, blew up the fortifications. The rebels set fire to
                  the City, blew up the locks. The mayor of the City came off and surrendered to
                  Capt Rowan, and requested him to assist in putting out the fire. Rowan said that
                  he could not consent to land &amp; if they saw fit to fire the City he could not
                  help it - that he could not lie under the imputation of having fired it. </p>

               <p>After spending a most miserable night I succeeded in getting on the Cossack it
                  looked very lonely and desolate, and I could not even sleep. I returned after
                  dinner with the baggage of our company- Capt Snyder of company G resigned on
                  account of ill health. His lungs are seriously affected. Lt Henry, Capt Picot
                  &amp; Dr Worthington rebel officers took dinner with the Col. recently is of the
                  regular rebel army fights with a will. Speaking of the Pilot that brought us up,
                  Bony somebody - he said so earnestly Well if he can reconcile it with his
                  conscience I’m satisfied. Worthington was the exaggerated southerner with long

               <p>This was a delicious warm day. I was detailed to bring up the days provisions from
                  the shore, about a mile. We had no transportation. Everything had to be carried
                  Barrels rolled - we laid a board path for nearly a mile over by land. In the
                  delicious air of the forenoon Jim Gibson George &amp; I sat on a pile of rocks by
                  the shore &amp; watched rebel officers march on board the Pilot boy to be taken to

                  <p>our friends Worthington Picot &amp; Kenney among the number. There were many
                     fine gentlemanly looking men, of all sort shaped [hats?]. It is said that the
                     officers of the Virginia Regt, when they started to come here, they for a fake
                     had their baggage marked New York - intimating they were going to fight their
                     way through - they go there in an unexpected way. A flag of truce came over
                     from Nag's head and took the bodies of Capt [?] &amp; Cole. Gen Burnsides
                     quarters were crowded with Islanders taking the oath of allegiance. We got in
                     to quarters along by our Company, accepting Capt Picots wounded, and I suppose
                     George's and mine were taken among them. If that is so I am well enough
                     satisfied.</p>

                  <head>Friday 14.</head>
                  <p>Another delightful day. Our Regiment was on guard yesterday and we were up last
                     night. I got a tub last night took a bath one of the Islanders had washed some
                     clothes for us - and now I feel a new man. Beaver and I went over to see the
                     site of Ft Raleigh. The [?] of a mound, but grown over with trees fifty or a
                     hundred years old, are to be seen. it is in an overgrown thicket. [Jim?] a
                     darky piloted us to it - He was ship launcher - that is helped to get off ships
                     that were beached - He said the rebels told him that we would put him in [?]
                     and take him to [?] and sell him. We passed the house of old [Dol?] - two
                     rebels in uniform were brought up to see the old man before he died. Yesterday
                     one of the barracks in which the rebel prisoners were, was taken for a
                     hospital, &amp; the prisoners were turned out, &amp; had to lay out all night.
                     It was a pity, but we were as bad for we have our men crowded in two small
                     rooms. This evening an order came that each captain should take five prisoners
                     into their quarters. It was an utter impossibility with me. Beaver &amp; I
                     talked with them last night a good deal. They are very ignorant - &amp; are
                     something like our rivermen without their smartness. We got our mail last
                     night. Rec‚Äôd three letters from John &amp; one from Annie. Our boys were
                     sitting around reading newspapers &amp; the rebels stared at them. They look
                     agape at us drilling. This afternoon Lt Col Bell took the regiment out along
                     the beach. Saw an ancient mill, where there were still remains of corn lately
                     ground. This with being on guard duty last night makes me undisposed to
                     write.</p>

                  <p>It was rainy, drizzling all day. About ten o‚Äôclock we had regimental drill
                     and marched down along the beach &amp; visited all the batteries. At the lower
                     one they were digging trenches, making bridges, drains &amp;c, and putting up a
                     telegraph up this way. We returned up the road about three o‚Äôclock hungry
                     enough to eat a good dinner. Dick had ready [for us?] of roast potatoes, fried
                     beef, coffee and butter &amp; crackers. Yesterday up at [Does?] they showed us
                     some fig trees - they resembled in appearance horse chestnut, not in leaf. Our
                     cooks were ordered on board to cook three days provisions and have them ready
                     by tomorrow evening. We understand that we are to go on some expedition and
                     return here - our camp equipage is to come on shore. </p>

                  <head>Sunday 16th.</head>
                  <p>Rained, fizzled, and was generally unpleasant. We had company inspection and
                     regimental, and service. Rodumel has quartered with us, &amp; we live as
                     comfortably as ever. Dick makes excellent tea and coffee, biscuit, and we have
                     had butter and canned tomatoes this several days. Tomorrow, we we hear, we are
                     to go on board the Cossack to go on some expedition, and are to return here.
                     The New York 51st remains on the island. An arrangement has been made to
                     exchange prisoners, and an oath has been to day administered to them not to [?]
                     against the U.S. until duly exchanged. Morris told me they had a communication
                     with Gen [?] stating that the Bull run prisoners would be exchanged first &amp;
                     then others as far as they go. One of the Louisianan‚Äôs formerly of New
                     Jersey, told us that a wounded rebel was waited on by his brother in our army
                     at one of the houses on the Island. As they passed up here, they found the
                     North Carolinians here, who told them they should go up &amp; fight, and after
                     the defeat, they came back this way &amp; found them cooking. They told them
                     there was a devil of an army coming after them - they got so scared they ran
                     around in a ring. An old negro gave a comical description - he said they ran
                     down to the shore, some of them stripped off their clothes, and they were all
                     bedassled.</p>

                  <head>Monday 17th</head>
                  <p>It rained furiously all morning. But quit toward noon. We were put in charge of
                     the prisoners in our camp somewhere near five hundred, and ordered to get ready
                     to go on board the Cossack as guard. About noon, the regiment formed to escort
                     them down, but the Adjt had neglected to give us orders, and in the stress of
                     time we had to get ready. Beaver was left to bring down the baggage - he got an
                     old go-cart, but we marched off without him. We were all put on board the
                     Dinkie, and taken to the Cossack - where we stowed them in the hold and between
                     decks - Many were sick and very miserable - we put them in the ladies saloon -
                     Little Connolly that spent the [snowy?] night with us is down with the
                     smallpox. I was talking to some of the prisoners - one of them asked me with a
                     seriousness that made me laugh, whether our government had not sold many of the
                     slaves taken from their masters &amp; that escaped to the Spaniards - that they
                     had been so informed - also they had been told that on our march up to [?] that
                     we had burned pillaged and destroyed - raped women - that many men had to stand
                     by and see their wives and daughters raped before their eyes. They asked me
                     whether they would not be allowed to go home before they would have to go into
                     service again, and said they would like to get out of it. We feel that we are
                     in rather disagreeable service, with the number of dirty filthy, sick men with
                     all sorts of diseases, mumps, fever, chicken pox &amp;c - but have said that we
                     are to do our duty, and leave the consequences in the hands in whom all things
                     are. We took possession of one of the bridal chambers. Mr Mallory, Charles
                     Mallory &amp; Capt Snyder are on board, &amp; we form a mess. Beaver &amp;
                     party got on board, in a surf boat with all our baggage last night which puts
                     us in good trim. I little thought when I sailed on the Cossack that I would
                     ever have charge of her.</p>

                  <head>Tuesday 18th</head>
                  <p>Our men were busy cleaning their arms and we put up racks amid ships. The
                     [light?] &amp; Capt Snyder went ashore. Kelly came back with him - having
                     absent two days without leave I put him under arrest. Two surgeons, rebels were
                     sent on board to attend to the sick. Of all miserable dirty squalid looking
                     men, these prisoners are the worst - We turned them out on deck and counted
                     them numbering 484. This evening we cleaned out the ladies cabin and made a
                     hospital of it. [?] &amp; mumps appear to be most prevalent. This evening the
                     Dinky came along side with 50 or 60 wounded prisoners There was a rebel doctor,
                     a very gentlemanly fellow, with them and he protested against putting them on
                     board. I felt disinclined as we had enough to do. So the capt of the Dinky,
                     Chambers, concluded not to put them on. The day was cold. A fleet with soldiers
                     came up the channel - some said the D'Epineuil Zouves were along. I never wish
                     to be put in charge of a prisonership. Though some are very intelligent the
                     majority are helpless as they are ignorant. They all tell us that we have
                     treated them very kindly. War is horrible. I first saw the pomp &amp;
                     circumstance - the battle field - the dead and wounded now the prison ship. I
                     felt relieved when they took away the wounded - we had no bed pans - and they
                     would have to evacuate as they lay - I could imagine what it would be by
                     morning, from what I have already seen. I understand we are to go to Elizabeth
                     City. My hope &amp; wish is to get there soon. Tom Grier came on board to see
                     us this evening. He looks very well.</p>

                  <head>Wednesday 19th</head>
                  <p>Clear. I went with Mr Carpenter, the mate down to the Picket, to inquire for
                     the mail, but found she had been only to Hatteras, &amp; brought none. Then we
                     went to Gen Burnsides Head quarters on shore to inquire for coal - then up to
                     Ft Reno to see our Quarter master about provisions &amp; went up to camp to see
                     our sick - they were in our old quarters but they had with chicken pox - two
                     others we have in the hospital. When we came down to the beach a party had a
                     little [bull?], like a two year old, but which a grey headed darky declared had
                     been on the Island 6 years, &amp; he was old then, hitched in a high cart,
                     filled with boxes and barrels. He walked off with [is?] [mountain?] load with
                     considerable care. We sent Bobst to shore, sick with the chicken pox. Shorkley
                     &amp; the Captain went over to Croatan island to the fortification that the
                     rebels blew up, on the day of the surrender. It was made by putting in two
                     canal boats end to end, and filling up outside with sod. A man said they had
                     about a thousand darkies. He said also that they had drafted on in three on the
                     Island &amp; this was the day they were to come after them. We got some sweet
                     potatoes and a bottle of milk. The sick are getting worse. The rebels had run a
                     gun boat through which we had put some holes into the shore at Croatan Island,
                     and there it sank. Our gun boats took away all the cannon burned the boats, adn
                     took up the engine &amp; boiler of the gun boat which were in good
                     condition.</p>

                  <head>Thursday 20.</head>
                  <p>This was a delightful day - like ours of May. I went ashore with Captain
                     Bennet. The prisoners were getting sick by the dozens, and the surgeons said
                     they would die in piles if we remained long. It smells dreadfully down there,
                     &amp; the filth &amp; dirt is indescribable. Although we have plenty of flour,
                     there is no means of baking - our hard bread was done, &amp; from the trouble
                     in getting [food?] seemed as it was, I was afraid of a row, if the want of
                     bread was added to the trouble. So we went up to Reno's quarters, and I gave
                     him the history - He said we would start this afternoon which was good news -
                     so when we got to the beach we saw the flag at half mast, blue, &amp; knew it
                     to be recall of all hands to the ship. I had fortified myself however with an
                     order to remove all my sick to the Peabody. We got to the Cossack in time for
                     dinner, twelve o'clock anchor hewed immediately and we ran up to where the
                     other vessels were anchored, just above the head of the Island, and along side
                     the Peabody. I communicated my orders, but just then Gens Burnside &amp; Reno
                     came up in [Ship?] Price, and orders were given to sail, so we concluded to
                     leave them on board. The day was bright and we went it gaily, the little tug
                     Champion leading the way, next the Spaulding, Peabody, Admiral, Cassock, New
                     York. The Spaulding was the officers and the Peabody the wounded and sick.
                     About four o'clock we entered Pasquotonk river. The shores were marshy and
                     lined with dark pines, with here and there an acre or two cleared, and a
                     windmill. At one place six windmills were congregated and ten were in sight, so
                     we neared Elizabeth City. There were plantations and some fine looking houses.
                     The most beautiful sight were successive [?] or steppes of dark green pines, of
                     different heights, thick and dark - as if they had been cleared and grown at
                     different pines. The water was dark colored like tan bark, the shores winding,
                     bluffed with groves of the tall yellow pine. We rounded a point and came in
                     sight of the place, a shire, tall brick buildings, like mills, apparently just
                     placed on shore among the tall pines. On the point was their fortification
                     tenantless, &amp; gunless, its magazine blown up, and near the shore wrecks of
                     gun boats, one a propeller perhaps the [Jamy?], and one a side wheeler. The
                     shore appeared close in here. The sunset was very beautiful - and the scene was
                     sombre enough - those pines give it a dark severe look - perhaps in the summer
                     it is brighter - but the most pleasant sensation was to see something of
                     civilization again - a town however small. As we came near, &amp; I saw the
                     houses &amp; farms on shore - Large fine looking houses, some with balconies
                     all around - in the calm evening much like our summer, I thought more of home,
                     and how I would live &amp; alter things in our old house, than I have done
                     since I left home. I was talking to one of the Surgeons - he said though he had
                     been very enthusiastic for southern rights, he thought if he got off he wouldnt
                     get in the army again.</p>

                  <head>Friday 21</head>
                  <p>It was bright &amp; fine this morning. The Spaulding &amp; Peabody were taken
                     up first to unload - The New York and then the Cossack. There is twelve feet of
                     water at the wharf and several fine brick warehouses, market houses and other
                     fine buildings. We could see up one of the streets, which was narrow lined and
                     arched with trees, &amp; in the summer time must be very pretty. The different
                     companies were called off, one at a time, and names called &amp; checked. We
                     met some of the officers Capt Picot Col Jordan &amp; others. Their tone was
                     changed, since they got on their sail out of reach of us - false fawning, in
                     order to get well treated, apparently grateful - The 3rd Georgia Reg't was on
                     duty &amp; I understood from one of their Lts, that they were on duty along the
                     canal, &amp; some bitter con- versation between them and our men ensued, until
                     I ordered mine on board. The officers lie to their men without doubt. Capt.
                     Picot said to his men as soon as he saw them "Boys I have good news for you -
                     we have licked them on the Cumberland and taken 5000 prisoners. That 3rd
                     Georgia Regt needs a dressing [bad?]. We all parted with bitterer feelings -
                     the much more so that the ungrateful dogs gave us such an ill return for all
                     the trouble &amp; exertion we made to make them comfortable. In the forenoon
                     while waiting for our turn I went with the Capt. on shore on to the ruins of
                     the Propeller [Jamy?]. &amp; where they had the battery - four guns lay there,
                     but their carriages burned &amp; their effectiveness destroyed. About four
                     under sail and steam ran down the sound, &amp; anchored at Roanoke Island about
                     seven o'clock. It was piercing cold this evening. The officers on the Spaulding
                     growled at their [fare?] but the Capt told them that they got better than they
                     deserved. <pb n="43"/>
                     <fw>Friday 21.</fw> In the ruined battery were buried two men Fred. [Herman?],
                     seamn &amp; Thos O'Mara Co A. Rhode Island Vols, who fell Feb. [10?], 1862 for
                     his beloved country, as it was inscribed on their head boards. The 3rd Georgian
                     Reg. wore our blue overcoats, and they have been captured in the [?].</p>

                  <head>Saturday 22.</head>
                  <p>This morning after a splendid sleep - relieved from all anxiety, whilst raining
                     very hard, I went off to shore and up to camp, where I was informed we were to
                     come over: owing to having no quarters I got permission of Gen. Reno to stay on
                     board until Monday morning. We got back in time for dinner. The Capt. was going
                     over to Burnside's quarters, &amp; as there was something said about
                     fumigation, I concluded to go too. We took poor little Cuffy over to the
                     Hospital to die perhaps - I heard the Capt brutally remark that he brought him
                     over to the hospital because he hadn't pine enough to make a coffin for him.
                     When I got there I heard Dr Church send an order to Gen Reno to have the 51st
                     Regiment P.V. separated from the others. He told me to get my company off the
                     Cossack as soon as I could. I sent word over to Shorkley to have them ready,
                     and took the back road up to camp. I met the Col. &amp; told him what I had
                     heard, I went to camp, then to the beach, found the Brigade commissary got a
                     little boat, rowed 5 or 10 miles, got to the Cossack just as the Company left
                     in the surf-boats - I went back to get quarters as the quartermaster hadn't got
                     our tents off as promised - I could not find any at Camp &amp; got an order
                     from Gen Reno to use the tents at Fort Park. So down we trudged all the way -
                     &amp; found the tents had no poles. However New Jersey boys turned in and
                     pulled the tents over the cook house made coffee for us &amp; treated us
                     splendidly. Capt Chesney treated me like a prince &amp; gave me a bed in his
                     tent.</p>

                     dull cloudy day we had a glorious sunset - I have not seen many finer things
                     than the look down over the Sound this evening.</p>

                  <p>It was very windy here today. The sound was lashed into fury and beat with a
                     roar on the beach. Dr Cutter &amp; Dr Hoosack were here today. It appears that
                     the cases we have had were [variolaid?]. We had one in the Cossack and four now
                     in the hospital. One man is broken out. We appear to have been the only company
                     in which it was any ways prevalent, and we have been ordered to stay here until
                     it is eradicated.</p>

                  <p>We sent Smith up to the hospital with the small pox. no other cases have
                     developed. The day was very pleasant and we drilled steadily. Dick has a very
                     bad cold and we are fearful that he is another case. There are others
                     apparently having bad colds and pains in the back - Confound it, I expect it
                     will prevent us from being along with the next expedition. In other respects it
                     has blest us with good quarters. We went up to the [?] and got a couple of
                     boxes &amp; then to the [?] where we saw Tom Grier.</p>

                  <head>Wednesday 26.</head>
                  <p>It was pleasant this forenoon. We drilled all day. About noon we were put in
                     possession of Ft Park. I did not remove from my present quarters in Meekin's
                     house, but detailed a guard of 14 to the fort. This evening rain set in &amp;
                     it is dreary enough. We have another case of small pox probably - at least the
                     symptoms of pain in the head and back like a bad cold, are very much like the
                     other cases. Well we are in for it &amp; a good time will have of it I expect.
                     When danger is near it hasn't near the ugly appearance it has when afar off. I
                     feel as easy about it as if I were at home. The only annoying thing is that it
                     will prevent our going with the expedition. I have really spent a delightful
                     time since I have been here, &amp; the prospect of a rainy day, which perforce
                     eased one from exertion is really delightful in contemplation.</p>

                  <p>Last night it stormed fearfully. It howled around our old barracks. This
                     morning however it was clear and bright &amp; cool. I went up to the Barracks -
                     the first thing I saw was them carry several drunk Irishmen across to the guard
                     house &amp; the next thing the Stler tent with three guards, &amp; and not
                     allowed to sell anything. They had searched the tent &amp; found some sherry
                     Brandy. We bought flour at the Brigade Commissary for 3 cts per pd - surgar 10
                     cts &amp; candles 25 - We [can?] pay anything at what the government pays. We
                     returned in time for company drill. The boys drill admirably &amp; if we only
                     have a week or two more we will get along. This afternoon we drilled as
                     skirmishers. The sunset was remarkably beautiful. Our house fronts on the shore
                     about a hundred paces from it. The sound is about five miles wide &amp; the
                     further shore gives a deep blue [?] - Tonight it was saffron and scarlet before
                     last gold and orange &amp; blue. At dusk Beaver &amp; I strolled up to the
                     Fort. The boys had a fire in the old cook house &amp; were sitting around <pb
                        n="44"/> its cheery blaze talking. These camp fires will long live in our
                     memories to be talked about when we go home. I bid them good night &amp;
                     thought amid all discomforts, war has many pleasant cheery phases.</p>

                  <head>Friday Feb. 28.</head>
                  <p>Contrary to our expectation from the terrible storm last night it was a bright
                     and beautiful day. Beaver &amp; I started with our walking across the Island,
                     &amp; came to a little house, where a woman &amp; two children sat by the fire.
                     Everything was neat &amp; clean and the floor nicely sanded. Can you do some
                     washing. No I ain't able to wash for myself. She said she was a widow - that
                     there were few women on this island that clean had died in two weeks: they just
                     took a pain in the head and the eyes swelled, and they died in two or three
                     days. We trudged back remarking that if we could have got our washing done we
                     would not have thought [the?] way half as long. We went on up to camp - bought
                     some butter at the sutler's for 45 cts per pd, &amp; rice of the commissary 6
                     1/2. We returned, whose orders in our absence came to be ready to be mustered
                     for pay. It was late in the afternoon when Lt Reno came, &amp; this evening we
                     had a game of ball - It has blown up quite cold.</p>

                  <head>Saturday March 1st 1862.</head>
                  <p>The morning was cold and clear - ice and a bleak wind blowing at all angles. Lt
                     Shorkley and I intended to be off early, on a trip to the battle ground, but
                     everything went wrong. As the wind was so variable, and the wooden chimney
                     after burning half up, was found not to work, we adopted the expedient of
                     cutting two pipe holes one out each side &amp; changing around the stove as the
                     wind changed. We had the pipe out the north side, but as it smoked, Dick
                     changed it to the South side - it smoked worse - so it was changed again to the
                     north - then again to the east - and again to the north where it was found to
                     do best, but miserable at [best?]. This occupied an hour and were smoked and
                     frozen nearly to death - once Shorkley broke the elbow - We have the Stove on a
                     box of sand, and it is pretty hard to move around. Dick in his efforts overset
                     a pan of slop water over the floor &amp; began to swear - Beaver scolded -
                     "Well between the smoking stove and oversetting that its enough to make any man
                     swear." At last the stove took a slight notion to burn and the shad was frying
                     briskly - I sat reading behind the stove - then was an exception - two pieces
                     of fish flew out on the stove and floor - spattered me with hot fat &amp; my
                     book all over. There never in all our house keeping such extraordinary trouble
                     nor were we all ever in such a bad humor. At last we got breakfast about nine
                     o'clock. Shorkley got started - went down past Park pt fort, along the beach
                     about two miles, when a [major?] met us: we followed some one's truck and bound
                     he had been fooled just as we were - we followed his track clear around the
                     swamp back to the beach &amp; then tramped back to Gen Burnside's head
                     quarters, crossed the camp of the 8th Conn &amp; took down a crooked road,
                     reached the main road, and after a walk of three or four miles the old battery
                     - Ft Russel We observed the trees marked with bullets more than 3/4 of a mile
                     back of it, and near it every tree was scarred and cut. The battery was built
                     in half moon shape, with three [?] very wide outside so as to give as wide a
                     sweep as possible to the cannon. [?], where the 24 pdr Dahlgren was, swept the
                     road - right in the centre. It was all cleared in front - &amp; the road runs
                     straight down about 1/4 of a mile and then bends to the right - &amp; the wood
                     is cleared so as that the road straight in front as also that of the bend. But
                     right in front of the battery just where we crossed showed the most marks of
                     bullets: two trees about 15-20 feet up were pierced through with cannon balls.
                     The pine tree where we lay down was full of bullet holes. We then went down the
                     familiar road, past where the field hospitals were, filled with groaning
                     mangled men when we passed there last to the landing. The owner had come back -
                     named Hayman, and it was at his landing instead of Ashby's where we landed. He
                     said he was there until near sunset - that they did not expect us to land there
                     but at Ashby's: that when he took is family across there the road was full of
                     troops - Between the road leading to Ashby's &amp; this place there is a deep
                     creek, and probably the rebels were afraid of losing their artillery, or they
                     would have attacked us there. This battery is but a half mile across &amp; it
                     could have been shelled by our gun boats had we known it. We walked down to
                     where we landed and saw our broad swaths across the reedy shore - then went
                     over to Ashby's We saw the young man there - he said he had been drafted - had
                     gone up the canal bridge - &amp; his lot fell on him &amp; they were to go home
                     and stay until called. From this landing where they expected us to land, there
                     is a road leading through a swamp [?] - when the rebels were posted with two of
                     their pieces that night they thought the water too low to land at Haymans. The
                     Ashbys raised a white flag - &amp; the rebel officers threated to take them up.
                     We saw the graves of our dead, one com. off Lieut Goodwin, &amp; one first
                     Serjt [Jeremiah?] W Morse - [?] - 23rd Mass 27 in all - 1 unknown 2 prob N.Y.
                     51 1 57th Penna. We returned the same way: met Alcott - had supper flour
                     cake.</p>

                  <head>Sunday March 2. 1862.</head>
                  <p>It rained and drizzled all day. The adjt came in this morning and told us to
                     have three copies of our pay rolls made out again one o'clock. So we set to
                     work &amp; it took us all forenoon. John Morris was here to dinner, He told us
                     we were to sail in a day or two - that the Generals had agreed to disobey
                     instructions &amp; not go to Newbern, We were to go some place where we would
                     be landed, and have a march of 60 miles to be done in two days &amp; strike a
                     blow that had ten chances to one of success - that any general would take one
                     in three. He also brought us the news that Nashville Memphis and Savannah had
                     been occupied by our troops: that Gen [Wool?] was in Norfolk with his staff by
                     invitation from rebel authorities - supposed that they [pushed?] to surrender
                     to him so as to take the chances as prisoners of war - What this means I can
                     not conceive. I occupied the afternoon writing to the Chronicle. So I suppose
                     we will have to hustle out of this in a hurry tomorrow or next day. We had
                     another abominable job with our stove this morning, trying it out the various
                     holes, and not succeeding in getting our breakfast until nine oclock.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <dateline>Monday 3.</dateline>
                  <p>This morning bright and clear again. We had another trouble with our stove and
                     had to clean [out?] the pipe. We have come to the conclusion that stoves were
                     not made for this part of the country. One day seeming this pitch pine wood
                     clogs up the pipe with soot and tar. Wide mouthed chimnies are the only
                     comforts, and in them we will not dare to build the fires too high or we will
                     set fire to the chimney. But if they are behind in many things, in building
                     chimnies they have succeeded admirably. We noticed this particularly in the
                     wooden ones put up in the wooden barracks, built by the Georgians. Beaver and I
                     had started up to camp, when we were met with the Col. with orders to pack up
                     and get up to the upper fort as quick as possible. We had nothing for
                     transportation except a small hand cart. We hauled everything to the [narrow?]
                     [path?] this side of Ft. Park, making a half dozen trips - carried them over to
                     the fort, then carried dragged, and pulled all up along the beach, through the
                     deep sand, up to the landing. It was a terrible job. It worried us very much.
                     There we met the rest of the Regiment, &amp; our baggage put on a boat to be
                     taken to the schooner, which was to take it to the Cossack. But the Schooner
                     went off without it and the boat had no oars. The Dinkey came &amp; we piled
                     the whole Regiment on it - our boat, which fortunately was in the same boat
                     with the Surgeon's, which gave it a better chance was poled down &amp; put on
                     the Dinkey. We got safely landed on the the Cossack about four o'clock. We had
                     scarce been on here an hour when Mr Walton came on with a large mail for us. I
                     received letters from John of the 19th &amp; 21st. In the latter he mentions
                     the receipt of mine of the 11th, and the grand jubilee over the victory of Ft
                     Donnelson. He enclosed a copy of the Times' correspondence describing the
                     battle. It is grossly inaccurate, and as if written by one who had not been on
                     the battlefield, but had picked up his intelligence from different mouths.
                     Morris told me that Smith, the Times correspondent, was down there the other
                     day with the [Gens?] &amp; some of the Staff, when the conversation ran on the
                     coolness of some artist sketching Gen Foster in the midst of the fire. Smith
                     said he was standing right by him. Frank Reno said you lie, you weren't there -
                     no one was near him." Smith was in to our quarters the other day, and he got
                     some yarns from me that made him gulp. We all now have separate messes on board
                     the Cossack. We have been told that we are going to Winton and from there to
                     Weldon. We have taken none but our well men along - being ordered to have none
                     but those who can stand a march of 60 miles in two days. New rifles, Enfield,
                     are on board for eight companies of our Regiment.</p>

                  <head>Tuesday 4.</head>
                  <p>The day was bright and clear. The sunset was very beautiful. The rifles were
                     distributed among our men. We sent Jim. Kelly off to shore, broken out with the
                     small pox. Surgeon Hassack got drunk yesterday and has been laying in bed,
                     sick, all day. Many of our men and officers are suffereing for want of
                     medicine. It is an outrageous shame that such should be the case, as no doubt
                     after the hardship undergone and the close quarters we had many would
                     necessarily become sick. The Col. said he had seen as much of it as he would.
                     Hassack would come down nearly everyday to our quarters to see our sick. He
                     would forget all about them, what he prescribed and what their ailments were,
                     and it was as much as we could do to get him to go and look at them. Several
                     days he wasn't fit to do anything and some days would not come down at all.
                     Then I've been told that Dr. Noble has got to drinking too, and was at least
                     once very much intoxicated.</p>

                  <p>The day was pleasnt, the water rough, however. This afternoon we had a
                     threatened storm that didn't amount to much but it was magnificent to behold.
                     The sunset was very fine too. In the open space between a bank of clouds that
                     rested on the shore and those that covered the sun there was the richest
                     [tracery?] in scarlet and vermillion, and above in the dark mess of clouds one
                     open spot golden hued. <pb n="46"/>

               <fw>Tuesday March 11th 1862 continued.</fw> 
               <p>The day passed without incident. I
                  spent most of the day reading Lossing‚Äôs pictorial field book, so far as it
                  related to North Carolina. One cannot help thinking that if they [slaves?] the
                  same spirit as they did in the days of the revolution it will be a difficult
                  matter to conquer. But their cause is not just as it was then - North Carolina
                  is not in heart as it was then. The men are as brave no doubt: but their enemy
                  is not three thousand miles away. There is not [Chatham?] in the Federal
                  Congress, or any portion of the people in the North that espouse their cause.
                  Their social institution is false at bottom. Capt [Ricot?] remarked to us that
                  there would not be such an universal resistance if it were not for the women.
                  In the [Michdenburg?] District in the days of the revolution the young ladies
                  formed an association agreeing not to receive the attentions of any young man
                  who did not join the army in defense of their country's rights, [?] a man who
                  would not fight for his country, would not be fit to be a protector of them.
                  Perhaps the feeling arises from the stories of rapes &amp; robberies told of
                  our army - perhaps because it is said we would arm their slave against them.
                  They know well that their husbands and brothers make concubines of their slaves
                  - that the slave if freed might wreak their vengeance on them. If I were a
                  Southern women my fears, if I honestly believed this of the northern design,
                  would drive me to a desperation. A tug boat came along side telling us she has
                  a mail for us - The last we had was about the 21st &amp; 22nd of February. 17
                  days ago. That was the last newspaper news we received. This will [bring?] a
                  little later. We appear more anxious to receive this than any other - perhaps
                  in prospect of a battle near - and it will be the last time many of us will
                  hear from home.</p>

                  <p>This was a delightful day, and nothing could be pleasanter than our journey
                     from Hateras to New berne? We [?] anchor at nine o‚Äôclock and steamed down the
                     Sound, past [?] inlet, [?] island [Brant?] Island shoals, and felt some what
                     anxious when we came to the place which indicated whether we went up the
                     Pamlico or Neuse. The Pilot soon assured us that we were for New berne sure,
                     but still it was disputed. About [?] o‚Äôclock we entered Neuse River and
                     steamed slowly up, the Gunboats [nosing?] into every bank and [?] until at 1/2
                     past seven we anchored. [?] some three miles from Newberne. An exciting chase
                     after two little sail boats by the Picket, she firing a shot across the bow of
                     each. We saw her come up with them in tow after dark. We observed all along the
                     shores fired kindled raising dense smoke, apparently signal fires to warn of
                     our approach. The sun set in glorious splendor over the quiet waters. Our band
                     played the national airs on deck in the quiet moonlight. Morris came on board
                     with orders. He gave us another report we don‚Äôt believe. That the Merrimac
                     came out at Norfolk, sunk the Congress and Minnesota, played [?] [?] with the
                     Cumberland, but the Little [?] stuck to her and disabled her so that she had to
                     put back to Norfolk. Now will take a good nights rest and prepare for the
                     battle tomorrow. I saw the adjt. write his resignation this evening. Ill health
                     the cause - hemorrhage of the lungs. We feel that we will succeed tomorrow, but
                     that it will be a hard fought battle. My hope is that Pennsylvania will not be
                     disgraced.</p>

                  <head>Sunday March 24th 1862.</head>
                  <p>This morning Tom Grier and Chas. Kline came down from New Berne in a boat. They
                     were with two officers who went down to visit the battle ground. But as they
                     didn't come back at 1/2 past twelve we took the boat and went to New Berne. It
                     is about a mile and a half or 2 miles by water. We landed by the Alice Price,
                     and went to a three strong ware-house, washed yellow, looked like Tom's house
                     at home. The rebels had used it for an ordinance room "No smoking" was painted
                     on the door "Yankee devils" inside They did not suppose that we would see it.
                     The room back used as an office was carpeted with cane, and nicely furnished -
                     had a grate. Upstairs above, they had fitted up a nice room - carpet,
                     bedsteads, mohair rocking chair, tables and chairs - fire place, with wood fire
                     quite a library - which they had gathered from various houses in town. Even
                     this gas fixture they had taken from some other house. This table had a fine
                     tea set &amp; everything a house keeper watned furnished from the same source.
                     I spent the afternoon &amp; evening with them and it was too luxurious. I
                     walked with Yerkes to the Cemetery. There is a wall and arched gateway around
                     it, built of a singular sort of [shelly?] conglomeration - would be very
                     handsome if finished. But it all bears the air of neglect. Founded many years
                     ago 1801 I think, by Christ Church transferred to the City of New Berne 1834 -
                     it had many old graves in it - We noticed that of the Gaston - Wm &amp;
                     Margaret. They had a singular way of putting a figure 1 before their figures,
                     so that one tombstone which told of us of a sea Capt. that died on his passage
                     from London to New Berne, in a certain lattitude and longi- tude, was aged 134
                     years. Another was 156. - We begn to think they had made voyages enough and it
                     were time he would cease going to down to the sea, when we discovered that it
                     must be either a _fashion_ they had or the oldest people lived here since the
                     days of the flood. We were pointed to a vault, which bore the marks of being
                     pried open, from which it was said Gen Burnside recovered $45.000. One iron
                     doored vault was open &amp; the coffins lay there exposed in a way that seemed
                     awful to me. <pb n="48"/>
                     <fw>Sunday March 24. Continued</fw> We returned to the Gaston House &amp; then
                     went back to Tom's quarters. Tom &amp; I started out to walk. Gen Burnsides
                     Headquarters were in an elegant marble house, with a large well kept yard in
                     front. The comical white guard tent pitched on the dark green grass, the two
                     wel dressed sentinels pacing up &amp; down, the roses blooming in the yard, all
                     made a striking picture. Near by was the lonly stacks of the chimnies of a
                     whole half square burned down. Near by the Neuse river are several houses, and
                     evidently stores burned. It looked odd to see a sign of "variety store"
                     flaunting before a scene of desolation - It was curious to notice the vagaries
                     that the fire caused in kegs of nails and other irons. The chimney stacks stood
                     up, &amp; one could not help picturing the bright cheerful parlors where those
                     fire places and grates were, adn beneath in the cellar lay the remains of the
                     fire screen. We went up to the Car house &amp; railroad depot. Cannon balls
                     &amp; shell lay all around &amp; in the Passenger Depot were cartrige boxes
                     [belts?], &amp; [accountants?] of all kinds, shell of a new kind with a new
                     kind with a brass [cork?], canister - a tin-case like a tomato can, filled with
                     54 canister balls. They had evidently just dropped everything and run. From the
                     letters we have picked up, they never dreamed of having to leave, &amp; yet the
                     Richmond papers say New Berne is of no account. It is to us if not to them,
                     though they must have esteemed it of some importance, from the amount of labour
                     they have bestowed upon its defence. I concluded to stay all night and passed
                     the evening cheerily by the bright fire place </p>

                  <p>I went to the Jenny - the Curlew runs over every 15 minutes, just where the
                     Bridge was burned. I was one minute too late. Just then Lt Shorkley &amp; Lt
                     Gaulen came up in a boat &amp; as they told me there was nothing to be done in
                     camp &amp; as my luxurious quarters last night gave me a cold, I concluded to
                     stay. I acted as guide, took them to see what remained of Gov. Lyon's palace,
                     the Cemetery, Car house. Then we went into a French Bootmakers. Gaulen talked
                     to him in his own tongue. Met Morris, who took us around to Gen Reno's
                     quarters, a white house nicely furnished. While here a Chaplain told us a
                     romantic story of Dr Cutter's daughter, Brigade surgeon of 2nd Brigade who died
                     this morning, here of what they call the Roanoke fever. She had requested to be
                     taken to Roanoke Island and buried beside a young man by the name of Plummer,
                     whose real name was Lidd, and was with John Brown in Virginia, and who had been
                     attacked by some disease of the stomach <pb n="49"/> the night before. The
                     battle of Roanoke and died the same night. We went from there &amp; dined at
                     the Gaston House. Corn bread, rice soup, roasted irish potatoes &amp; rice
                     pudding was all [?], at the first class hotel. [And?] a morself of wheat
                     bread.</p>

                  <p>I was unwell from my cold all day. It was a bright fine day however. Morris was
                     down to see us, but I was so unwell, I did not enjoy anything. We received a
                     mail from home. Letter from John from the 14 - to the 20th March. We also got
                     papers containing the accounts of the battle of New Berne. Some of them are
                     very absurd.</p>

                  <p>I am still unwell with cold and passed part of the day between blankets. It
                     commenced raining about ten o'clock and it was very pleasant to hear it patter
                     on the tent cover. The Adjt was to town and brought us the news that New
                     Orleans was taken and that there was a big connonading at Island No 10. &amp;
                     that our fleet had to withdraw from want of ammunition. We had to make new pay
                     rolls to day again. We expect pay pretty soon. Col. Hartranft, received news
                     yesterday of the death of one of his children, and serious illness of others,
                     received a furlough for 20 days &amp; sailed in the New York. We got some yeast
                     powder &amp; Dick baked us some elegant raised bread for supper. It was a
                     really luxury to have it. Hassenplug &amp; Erwine go home on furlough, or
                     [recruiting?] service after pay day.</p>

                  <head>Thursday 27.</head>
                  <p>Still suffering from my cold. Discovered the cause. I have been accustomed to
                     wearing top boots &amp; heavy sky blue pants. Very foolishly on Saturday after
                     our return I put on cloth pants, and shoes, &amp; have been wearing them since,
                     though it has been considerably colder. Never thought of it, until this morning
                     &amp; have reverted to my top boots again. This afternoon Beaver &amp; I took a
                     stroll down to Ft Ellis [8 Dupre?]. This fort here is Ft Lane, five guns. The
                     next below is fort Ellis of nine guns - built of sand shows a terrific
                     explosion. The field all around is full of shell &amp; canister, scattered all
                     around - pieces ofthe magazine hinges of the door - broken arches lying all
                     around. Below this is Dixie. Its construction is peculiar. A heavy frame of
                     logs, floored, covered and sided with planks - two rooms thus made for two
                     rifled guns. Outside frames of [?] are made about the <pb n="50"/> size of
                     barrels and filled with sand, connected by bundles of [?] 20-30 feet long.
                     These are built all around and over them making them bomb proof. We could see
                     that the [?] were tied with ropes taken from the sunken schooners - where they
                     were cut off the sails. Below This are frames where they made these bundles.
                     One of these guns was dismounted and spiked. There was preparation for building
                     another of a similar kind near it. They named that saucy thing very properly
                     Dixie. The next one below of 13 guns is called Ft Thompson. We got back in time
                     for dress parade. We pulled for some moss that grows on the trees here. It was
                     the first thing I noticed when I landed at Slocum creek. It is of grayish color
                     and looks like the beard of an old man tied fast to limb. It has that
                     peculiarity that it don't creep along the limb, but hangs in a bunch as if tied
                     to it. We had an elegant supper of fritters, bread, omelette, ham, fried
                     potatoes &amp;c. We move our camp up near Gen Reno's head quarters tomorrow. We
                     have now two cases of [?] in our company Hartz and Dougherty - Captain Taylor
                     is down with it too.</p>

                  <p>This was a bright fine day - a languid summer day. Part of the Regiment moved
                     to our new camp nearer to town, but still on this side of the Trent, near to
                     where we bivouaced the first night. I was officer of the day, though I was so
                     horase that I could not speak above my breath. Toward evening I think my cold
                     is broken up some.</p>

                  <p>We moved up to day. We had been promised teams, but they didn't come, so we
                     tugged away at a hand-cart &amp; we were nearly done, some one had raised a row
                     over in town, and five 4 horse teams came in the afternoon, &amp; before
                     evening we had all our luggage up. We have a motley collection of tents, some
                     of the 21st Mass, Sibley, Wall, common tents, great lumbering tents of the
                     rebels. We managed to get two nice wall-tents &amp; I pitched them at right
                     angles - then we got part of a sibley &amp; made a portico in front - it looks
                     [Swiss?] - One Dick has for his department. The other we eat &amp; sleep in We
                     have it all floored very nicely, &amp; tonight feel as if we were at home
                     again. It seems like our canvas home at Annapolis.</p>

                  <p>It was dark and gloomy and rained most of the time. Tom. Grier came over and
                     took dinner with us. [?] Kline &amp; [?] were here too. Lt. Applegat, formerly
                     1st Srgt. of Co. M. 9th New Jersey was in to see us. The 2 lts of his [?] had
                     resigned, &amp; the day before the battle he had appeared as 2nd Lt, in the
                     Battle. Capt. McChesney was wounded &amp; he has been in command ever since.
                     Capt. McChesney was wounded early in the fight. As some of his men were
                     carrying him back he saw Capt Hayes of their Regiment a german company come
                     retreating. He ordered him back. Andn as the Capt. didn't seem disposed to
                     obey, he drew his revolver on him, and the Capt. got behind a tree. Then
                     McChesney ordered the men that carried him to lay him down, and charge bayonets
                     on them. They did so &amp; the Capt. led his company back, &amp; they behaved
                     very galantly.</p>

                  <p>Themorning was raw and chilly - such as we have in September. Then the sun came
                     out about ten o'clock and was very hot until evening, when it became chilly.
                     Whiskey has been ordered to be served to the men, an ounce in the morning I had
                     determed to make application for a commission in the regular army, &amp; got a
                     recommendation from Lt. Col. Bell. I went over to Gen Reno. He and Gen Burnside
                     both advised me to hold on to my rank here, as the army would be reorganized,
                     and Captains would receive pommissions to recruit companies: that I could not
                     get a higher rank than 2nd Lieut &amp; would have to rise from it. Morris &amp;
                     I rode out about a half mile, where Capt. Williamson was building a fort. This
                     is large to contain 8 acres, an enclosed fort, &amp; is about a half mile from
                     the Trent. Another is to be built 3/4 of a mile further toward the Neuse, &amp;
                     about a half mile from it. We had dress parade this evening &amp; Lt. Shorkley
                     acted as adjutant, Bible being sick. Since last night, everything has moved
                     with an unusual.</p>

                  <head>Tuesday April 1. 1862.</head>
                  <p>The day was hot, the sun making it so - but the air would at times feel chilly.
                     I was quite unwell during the forenoon, weakened down by my cold and diarhaea.
                     After dinner owing to some startling rumors I was induced to [?] over to New
                     Berne. The [?] was as still as death, but the quiet work going on amazing.
                     Artillery was being hauled out back of town: the 57th N.Y. &amp; 11th Conn.
                     sent to work on the fort. Our pickets had been attack last night one killed -
                     one rebel killed &amp; a deserter came in, who gave the information, that 5000
                     rebels were five miles this side of Kingston, and 25.000 in Kingston advancing
                     this way, under command of Gen. Ransom, an old West Pointer, well known to our
                     Generals, and said to be a man of considerable dash. <pb n="52"/>
                     <fw>April 1 continued.</fw> The [?] [?] was sent to Hatteras last night at
                     twelve o'clock to hasten the reinforcements. The Admiral came in while I was
                     over there, &amp; we saw the Cossack go up afterwards I met Fitzpatrick, cor.
                     of Herald, who gave me papers with the news of the Battle of Winchester. He
                     said the 17. Mass. 103. N York, &amp; 2 Maryland were there - &amp; some
                     batteries in all 3000. [Parke's?] Brigade with the companies New Jersey are at
                     F Macon, so that we have of our old force, 25. 23. 27. 24. Mass 10th 11th Conn,
                     51st N.Y. 57. Penna. 21 Mass, &amp; 4 companies 9th New Jersey, 6 of the 48th
                     Penna, about 6000 effective men, &amp; the reinforcements 3000, 9000 in all. It
                     is wonderful how reduced the regiments are by sickness and death. Our regiment
                     for instance, had but 450 men on dress parade - &amp; say [200?] guard &amp;
                     other details makes us a little over 500 strong. I have nineteen sick in my own
                     company. But prospects of a battle would call the sick out. It appeared to be a
                     matter of anxiety to Gen Burnside that the troops were broken down so, and he
                     attributed it partly to want of fresh beef &amp; vegetables &amp; he said that
                     he had written to Washington urging beef to be sent. If the rebels wouldnt come
                     for a week, they couldnt come past that fort. Col. Bell says his orders are
                     that if he hears heavy firing to form and march to the Ferry. Lt Bell that was
                     with Capt. McRae in the battle with the Texans and New Mexico was his
                     brother.</p>

                  <head>April 2 Tuesday</head>
                  <p>Bright and warm. We were ordered out somewhere about nine or ten o'clock to go
                     down &amp; receive the 2nd Maryldn &amp; marched to the river, &amp; lay there
                     until near one o'clock, when Gen. Reno reviewed us, &amp; told us to go back to
                     camp. After dress-parade we got orders to move on to the other side of the
                     river in the morning. We have [?] 4 regts 103 &amp; 13 New York, 2nd Maryland
                     &amp; 17 Mass. We feel some regret that we leave our camp, now that we just got
                     cleverly fixed. It is probable that the rebels have not more than 15.000 men at
                     Kingston, &amp; if they give us a few days they cant faze us. Chas. Merrill
                     &amp; Warner were promoted to the Corporals to day and Aaron Smith to the
                     vacant Serjeantry.</p>

                  <head>Wednesday 3.</head>
                  <p>It was very warm to day. I was officer of the day. We struck tents about noon
                     and having procured a large flat boat, the tents were first loaded on it &amp;
                     poled up the river. The Regiment then marched off with knapsacks. All the rest
                     of the baggage was carried to the shore. Such a miscellaneous lot of stuff I
                     never beheld, not in the most active of April 1st, The flat returned about
                     eight o'clock in the evening, &amp; we loaded all but the Hospital &amp;
                     Commisary stores. We got up to the landing somewhere about twelve o clock at
                     night. The night was starlit, &amp; it was a pleasant trip up, the wind and
                     tide being in our favor.</p>

               <div>
                  <head>Thursday 4th</head>
                  <p>Early this morning we unloaded the baggage, and got it on shore about a quarter
                     of a mile from camp. The camp is at the west end of the town. <pb n="53"/> The
                     first Brigade being all here except the 21st Mass &amp; 2nd Maryland, just in
                     rear of the fort that is in process of erection. It is a large one [?] near
                     eight acres. The western Bastions are nearly completed Cannon are planted all
                     along in the rear of it and in front of our camps. Gen Reno was here to see us
                     this morning. The place is high &amp; dry - but no doubt the sand will prove a
                     nuissance. About here the land is well cultivated, but the fences go down like
                     [?] as each regiment comes in to encamp. Most of the day was spent in getting
                     up our stores. It is pleasant to be here in a civilized place again. We
                     received orders showing that the army is now divided into divisions two
                     Brigades in our Regiment. We do not know how we are brigaded, but hope Col.
                     Hastraupt will have command of one Brigade. The difficulty rests in the fact
                     that the date of his muster is junior to any other Colonel. It is absence now,
                     too, may operate against him. Shorkley and I took a stroll down town. It must
                     be beautiful in the summer. Splendid trees over arching every treet, the quaint
                     old houses, giving one a feeling of satisfaction you do not experience, which
                     seems a [word?], in fact, when you go into the handsome newly built northern
                     towns. Peach trees are loaded with blossoms. Vegetation has com- menced, and
                     the buds on the trees are bursting.</p>

                  <head>Sunday April 6th</head>
                  <p>Yesterday and the day before we did little else than fix up our camp. We had a
                     short Regimental drill in the afternoon. Our men have forgotten some but the
                     ground was very rough. In the afternoon we were blessed with the arrival of a
                     very large mail from home. I received three letters from John &amp; 2 from
                     Annie &amp; one from Laura. The last one is dated March 31st, so that it came
                     through in five days. Both last evening this evening, Lt. Col. Bell and I took
                     a stroll through the quiet old town. The streets are lined with high arching
                     trees, and the leaves are just budding. There are many fine houses, but the
                     beauty of them is in the large grounds around them and the shrubbery. Roses are
                     blooming, &amp; the lilac &amp; locust are out. The multiforce is crowded. It
                     must be a charming place, and one could not help thinking of the pleasant
                     social times they must have had in times past. There is wealth and leisure.
                     Where Capt Ritchie has his quarters, was the office and rooms of a bachelor
                     Lawyer, built in a cross shape, &amp; the Col tells me has every luxury of
                     library office, bed room, dining[?] bath &amp;c. It was said that at his
                     parties, he always refused to drink wine, &amp; kept up the impression that he
                     was temperate. His servant, whom Capt Ritchie has with him, on the Capt's
                     observing a number of bottles in a closet marked "[haregonic?]" that he would
                     at times drink a bottle of it, <pb n="54"/>
                     <fw>April 6. continued.</fw> and lie for a day or two, perfectly besotted. He
                     was in that con- dition when the attack was made on Newbern, &amp; had to be
                     carried away. We had company inspection in the forenoon. Tom. Grier came and
                     took dinner with us. The day was delightful, &amp; we went up to the platforms
                     &amp; one of the curtains is partially completed. I suppose that the alarms
                     &amp; fuss last week was caused by a Dr Thompson of the First Brigade, making a
                     false alarm. Morris said he had bought about 70 bales of cotton of an old
                     fellow out in the country, and after he had paid the money, some rebel cavalry
                     came down and burnt it. An order was read on dress parade last night, sending
                     the doctor to report at Washington with the recommendation to the Secretary of
                     War to dismiss him from service - that soldiers lost enough rest &amp; sleep
                     not to be annoyed by false alarms and that all alarmists would be dealt
                     summarily with. We formed under arms and marched into the Presbyterian church,
                     where Mr Mallory preached. We heard also a part of the grand concert given by
                     the 24th Mass Band, Gilmore's in front of Gen. Burnsides headquarters. After we
                     got back we found all our men from Roanoke Island had got back except Murphy
                     &amp; Adam Henry, how have [?] fever. We look very red &amp; some few will be
                     marked. Poor Jim Kelly died on the 27th of March - he was delirious for 8 days
                     and swore like a trooper until he died. It was owing to his impudence stripping
                     stark naked - he was so selfruled they could not get him to take any care of
                     himself. His side on which he lay was completely rotten - in fact he was one
                     mass of corruption. I am glad the rest have gotten over it so happily. We have
                     yet two cases on the other side of the River. We heard, through Gen Burnsides
                     spies, who have just returned from Suffolk, that Gen. [Hendleman?] had taken
                     Yorktown with 180 pieces of cannon. Our friends in the North appear to have
                     been uneasy about us, for fear that we would get caught in a trap. Gen.
                     Burnside has been kept thoroughly informed of everything that has taken place.
                     His spies are everywhere, &amp; he has a very finely organized system. Many are
                     New York detectives. Six of them were on board the Cossack, &amp; it was a long
                     time before we knew who they were. They appeared and disappeared - where we
                     never saw. One I remember did not come on board for a long time, when the
                     morning we left Hatteras to come here, he suddenly turned up. You would take
                     him for a Jersey huckster rather than a detective. We were on board a week with
                     them when we had the prisoners. We kept the prisoners below except at certain
                     hours, when the detectives would stay in their rooms. <pb n="56"/>
                     <fw>April 6 continued.</fw> It is wonderful that a change the appointment of
                     Corporal has made on Charles Merrill. He is dressed very neatly and his hair
                     and beard nicely trimmed, and appears to feel for the first time in his life
                     that he has some responsibility. He does his work carefully and intelligently,
                     &amp; take a great interest in it.</p>

                  <p>It was bright fine summer morning but commenced raining about twelve o'clock,
                     &amp; rained until evening. We had regimental roll call, &amp; company drill. I
                     spent most of the day in writing letters to John &amp; Louisa &amp; one to Jim
                     Kelly's wife. This evening Beaver and I [shotted?] down town. It was very
                     desolate. The [sandy evil?] drinks in the rain as fast as it falls. It looked
                     odd to see the rain come pouring down, &amp; sort of melt away like snow.</p>

                     parade. Rec'd a mail from home - two letters from John to the 2nd April. We had
                     our pay rolls signed and will probably be paid tomorrow morning.</p>

                     again. Paymaster Maj. Sherman came here and paid off the Regiment in three
                     hours. It was very surprizing to see how large the companies turned out. I
                     looked at Capt. Blairs company of ninety five men - I have not seen so large a
                     company since I left Harrisburg.</p>

                  <head>Sunday 13. </head>
                  <p>On Thursday morning I went with Lt Morris on board the [Vidette?] with 3
                     companies of the New York 51st to go up the Trent to Pollocksville. Everything
                     seemed against the expedition. I felt badly, and as if I had no business to go
                     along, though I had the Gen. &amp; Lt Cols' permission. Took breakfast with
                     Morris and went down to the river. The Ocean Wave took us to the Vidette - The
                     New Yorkers were mysterious [?] they were on a serious expedition. I suppose
                     their reporter was along - I know Mr Schell was along - &amp; when we ran
                     through the draw of the bridge and knocked one half of it down, he made a fine
                     sketch of it. We had no surgeon - I went to Gen Reno - he sent me to Dr Cutter
                     - he to the Surgeon of the 2nd Maryland, but as they were across the river, we
                     concluded not to go after him, as we had a Dr from Pollockville <pb n="57"/> on
                     board, when [Baron?] Egglestein of N.Y. 3rd had taken up, whilst visiting a
                     patient, with another man named [Baras?] a merchant up there, bound hand &amp;
                     foot &amp; sent him down as a spy. We ran aground a mile up above the bridge
                     &amp; put them ashore to foot their way up. We lay all night then came down,
                     got two tugs and pulled her off. So ended the Expedition. Saturday I was
                     officer of the day. While standing out by the road, a horse came along with a
                     coffin, followed by a buggy with a little boy. It was going out of town.
                     Another buggy came in with two ladies, and when they saw the hearse, they set
                     up the most piercing screams - they beckoned to me to aid them in getting a
                     pass to follow the body out. They were the mother &amp; aunt of the boy 16
                     years old, who had come to town &amp; died suddenly of congestion of brain. I
                     suppose he was a rebel soldier, but I did not press inquiry. Today I went with
                     Tom Grier down over the battle ground. We took pleasure in having out the big
                     [pine?] trees. We found a ram-rod whose end had been bent by a bullet, and near
                     it a bullet that fitted the indentation on the rod - evidently the same bullet
                     that hit it. The trees showed wild shooting on both sides. The horses had been
                     buried in the trench &amp; a very disagreeable odor prevailed. We heard the
                     news that a battle had been fought at Corinth and after two days hard fighting,
                     the rebels defeated, Gen Albert Sidney Johnston killed, &amp; Beauregard an arm
                     taken off. The loss on both sides great. This battle I feared most of all. It
                     is the last struggle for the Mississippi valley.</p>

                  <p>I have been exceedingly unwell - had to leave the drill this afternoon. I got
                     some medicine, went out to dress parade &amp; it had a bad effect on me. My
                     head is giddy, bones ache, burning fever. but I hope I'll be better soon. We
                     have the news of the Battle of Corinth confirmed.</p>

                  <p>I have been under the weather and staid in my tent all day. This morning I felt
                     pretty bright but towards evening the head-ache came again &amp; this evening I
                     consulted the Doctor again, who gave me a prescription with directions to take
                     it tomorrow if I could sleep to night. My appetite is extraordinaly good. Gen
                     Reno with 3 regts from here 21st Mass, 51st N.Y. &amp; 48 Penn go to Roanoke
                     tomorrow where they take on 3 regts &amp; go some place else. Though the news
                     of the defeat at Corinth is here, yet our Generals think this is the most
                     critical point of the War. The senseless cry against McClellan is creating
                     alarm, Burnside, Reno, Parke &amp; Foster say that they will resign the day
                     they hear that McClellan is removed.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>[out of numbers - this page and next taken from scans] We had one man killed,
                     Hoffman of Hassenplug's company and some wounded. He had his whole stomach
                     knocked out with a [?] of shell. I struggled on foot - by foot. What most made
                     me feel badly was that I should become exhuasted just at such a critical time.
                     But many were like Officers &amp; men. We at last came to a road: the regiment
                     was sent in to the left. I sat down &amp; lay down - I thought would die.
                     Alcott came along and put a flask of whisky to my lips and a few swallows
                     revived me. We staid there, sending in all the straglers. Col Bell sent for the
                     21st Mass &amp; they came up in good order - They had stopped and rested. I had
                     a large party of stragglers &amp; started in with them the direction the rest
                     had gone. I met Gen. Reno. He told me to keep down toward the left. He appeared
                     to be mad about something. I went to the road &amp; then in. Lt Shorkley came
                     out &amp; lead the Mass 21 &amp; lead them into position to the right of us. By
                     the time I got into a big oak tree, I saw [?]] [] [w.k.?] streaming back, asked
                     where his company was - said some were in there - I found there was no company
                     [?] in battle - a serjt &amp; corporal all that was known to exist &amp; they
                     with Blair. By this time my stragglers had fizzled out wonderfully - I had but
                     two or three of my own men. I came on to my own men [lost?] there a few shots
                     were fired, &amp; some one cried out don't fire, they are our men. Capt Blair
                     shouted to our color bearer to raise their colors high. We soon found out who
                     they were - The infernalist shower of bullets came in on us that I ever
                     witnessed. Two of my men fell, Lunig shot in the jaw, &amp; Buskirk in the arm.
                     But he game them [peper?] back. The colors were a good mark to fire at &amp; I
                     ordered them lowered. The 9th N. York made a charge - came out in beautiful
                     order - but the distance was great and they were exhausted - the rebels played
                     into them with canister &amp; ball - so the[?] over the [?] onto us. I thought
                     the rebels were charging us, &amp; gave my men orders to fix bayonets. I soon
                     saw the red hats however. It did not make our men even quiver - They stood
                     steadily firing. Directly we moved to the right, down along the fence - when
                     the order was given to charge - down went the fence, over we went pell mell our
                     flag ahead. Brouse of Hassenplug's company fell shot through the head. I had
                     just reached a ditch, when I felt a sharp pain in my side &amp; sickness
                     deathly - fell and was unconscious for a little while - but recovered &amp;
                     staggered on, supported by some of my men. I am yet unable to say whether it
                     was a faint or something struck me. I can't find any mark. The rebels left. But
                     we were unable to pursue, being too much exhausted. We formed &amp; I had the
                     roll call, &amp; found four men wounded - some missing - [Luning?], Buskirk
                     McCormack, &amp; [Vandine.] [next]

              <div>       <fw>On Board Guide Thursday April 17.
                        1862</fw> 
                 <p>Yesterday we got orders about noon to go on board the "Guide" with
                     six days provision. In two hours we were on our march. Leaving all the sick we
                     have seven hundred solid men with us. We marched through New Bern, past Gen
                     Burnside's &amp; Reno's headquarters - The streets of the town are sandy like a
                     sea-shore - the day was very hot - &amp; though equipped for light marching it
                     was very hard on us. We went to the wharf at the Railroad Depot, on the
                     [Neuse?], &amp; the Pilot-Boy took us One wing at a time, down to the Guide
                     lying below Town. The Guide is a very fine boat 32 feet longer than the Cossack
                     - &amp; [?] [state?] [fines?]. We are quartered very comfortable, though the
                     men are very much crowded, and between decks it is very hot. Capt Shawl as
                     usual drunk as a fool - I was reading at the table when he came up, took the
                     light and made a drunken endeavour to light his pipe. My first im- pression was
                     that the wind had blown it out. As I looked up he had his pipe upside down,
                     swaying to &amp; fro until he scorched his nose. "Don't you like it you can
                     lump it" he said. I now register this now, that [twere?] I have excused his
                     impertince, because he was drunk, but here after, I will go upon the rule of
                     law as to drunkeness, that is - every man is supposed to know the consequences
                     of his own [?]. He commenced talking about getting killed - that we were to
                     have a battle on this expedition. I shall never vary my belief in his innate
                     cowardice. The only time he kept sober was when he led us away from
                     Centreville. He was drunk when we landed at Roanoke, he was drunk at the
                     battle. He was drunk at Slocum's creek &amp; presented a most contemptible
                     aspect - having fallen in the mud. The hair matress was too warm for me to
                     sleep on, in the close state room, having slept in the open air for a month.
                     Toward morning it became cooler &amp; I slept. I have today been better than I
                     have been for sometime. I have been bothered with pain in the back, head and
                     back of the neck &amp; stomach - I was not alarmed though they were symptoms of
                     small-pox. But to-day my both hands broke out with red-spots &amp; pimples.
                     There we are thinks I - only regretting that I was not back to New Berne, and
                     the length of time it would put me off duty. However after looking at it
                     suspiciously all day, I found they turned out to be watering pimples - Bless my
                     soul - was ever man known to rejoice that he had caught the Itch - [?] it was -
                     &amp; no small-pox -</p>

                  <fw>Thursday 17. continued. </fw>
                  <p>We left New Berne about six o’clock. We looked with interest, at Slocum’s creek
                     - but I spent most of the day on the confessions of Love queen. We passed
                     Ocracoke inlet about 11 o’clock, passed a steamer, Port Royal, and 7 schooners
                     - Hatteras inlet somewhat after one, and got aground between 4 &amp; 5 miles or
                     so this side of Roanoke Island, just the place where the Guide got aground when
                     we first went up. The Massasoit came down about dusk &amp; took our men off to
                     lighten the boat. The Cossack passed us taking the sick and wounded north.
                     There is something singular about this expedition. The N.Y. 51, Mass. 21. 48
                     Penna were ordered to go on it. Lt. Col. Bell &amp; some of our officers were
                     sitting on the Gen-Court Martial, &amp; Capt. Mitchel 51 N.Y. &amp; other
                     officers had just got excused, to go on the expedition, &amp; they were
                     twitting Lt Col. Bell on his noting left behind, when the order came
                     countermanding the orders of other Regiments and our one substituted. The
                     officers of the other Regiments are as mad as forty. An inspection of marching
                     return showed that our Regiment has as many effective men as the other three
                     together. Gen. Reno &amp; Burnside are to join us. Co. E. Capt Hassenplug’s
                     Company had to go without a commissioned officer. Foster is evidently
                     consumpted &amp; it will go hard with him if he gets home. He may attribute it
                     all to his own work - dissipation especially at Harrisburg. When our Regiment
                     came on board, one of the the hands asked where we were from - said that we
                     were the quietest men he ever saw - It took but a half of hour before every man
                     was quiet in his bunk - every other Regiment he said, in a half hour would have
                     the ship upside down in a half hour. The Capt asked the Col. to make proper
                     arrangements for order. The Col said he shouldn’t trouble about that - “Thats
                     what the Cols of other regiments said &amp; we always had a row.” The Capt
                     [bail] expressed himself agreeably surprised. He is a young man, highly
                     educated, literary - mode sailor and though very young has been master for nine
                     years. We are happily off now, but ...

               <head>Friday 18th</head>
               <p>This was a bright fine day. We
                     ran up toward the head of the Island and got aground. We were better off on the
                     Ocean Wave. and with the assistance of the tug Champion, the Guide got through
                     and anchored above the light house. The Northerner came up with the 21st Mass
                     and anchored near us. About 3 o’clock the Picket, Phoenix, Massasoit, Ocean
                     Wave and Pilot Boy came along with hooks. They were the 6th N.H. 9 &amp; 89
                     N.Y, 21 Mass. We were to wait until the Phil. came along She came with a flat
                     and guns on, and about five o’clock got under way across the Sound. The wind
                     blew strongly and it was very rough making some sea-sick. We understand that we
                     are to land at Elizabeth City, march up to Grape Mills destroy the locks &amp;
                     come down the left Bank- root out some batteries. Its said our friends the 3rd
                     Georgia &amp; Lousiana Tigers are here - and that Gen Wise was seen in EC
                     yesterday </p>

                  <fw>Friday 18. continued </fw>
                  <p>The weather was warm but the wind makes it cool this evening. Eight o'clock
                     aground again. It would be very mortifying if we were left behind - especially
                     would the jealous party for whom we were substituted would twit us. I have been
                     unwell most of the day. But this evening I am pretty well. If the march is 25
                     miles it will go tough with me.</p>

                  <head>Saturday 18 </head>
                  <!--Linn misdated this - in 1862 Saturday was the 19th of April. -->
                  <p> We lay after getting off until near three o'clock when the Picket came down
                     after us, and they found the mouth of the Pasquotank and proceeded. The Light
                     house had been burned down so that our pilot, not a good one at best, could not
                     find it. About five o'clock we reached the landing place, a sort of bend or
                     pocket just below Elizabeth City. The three regiments had reached here about 2
                     o'clock and had gone on. Our gun boats were lying here in force. The light
                     boats took us off and ran as near shore as they could, then the small boats
                     took us as near as they could, and we waded the rest of it. Very few but got in
                     over the knees. After pulling off our boots and wringing our stockings we
                     formed. We had been divided into two brigades - first of 3 regts. 9th N.Y. 89.
                     N.Y. &amp; 6 N.H. and second Brigade 51st Penna &amp; 21 Mass. About seven
                     o'clock we got under way. Two 4 horse wagons, with our combustibles and two
                     pieces of cannon under Col. Howard ahead. The 21 Mass in the rear. We marched
                     on some two miles and reached Curituck Court House. It was built of brick -
                     there was a low jail, &amp; several houses around. We then marched on, through
                     a beautiful country, well cultivated, nice houses, and over a nice clay road,
                     which it was a pleasure to go over. After going about five miles we came to a
                     hand board which said 8 miles to the river bridge, we turned into another road
                     and halted. Suddenly the Maj of 21st came along, and the cry was to arms - we
                     formed - but it was discovered that the first brigade had lost their way and
                     went about ten miles around. We then proceeded, our brigade in advance. From
                     twelve o'clock until towards one, we were marching very steadily, our men were
                     dropping with fatigue, Morris rode along. I stopped &amp; told him our men were
                     dropping out by scores - I was most miserably exhausted. I could scarcely move
                     my legs. I had eaten nothing for two days, &amp; had a raging fever last night.
                     We had observed a dense heavy smoke ahead, across the road extending over a
                     considerable area of ground. We supposed it was a bridge burning. Morris had
                     scarcely passed, when a cannon opened, and a six pound ball struck in a
                     ploughed field about two hundred yards to our left, &amp; rolled and bounded on
                     past. Immediately a discharge of canister followed. We halted. Got over into
                     the field to our right and formed in line of battle. The cannonade was kept up,
                     the canister striking in front and the round balls in front, and some went over
                     our heads. We could see them quite plainly. But we could not see where they
                     came from on account of the smoke. In crossing into the field, there was some
                     confusion, and I ran after stragglers to get them into ranks. I had no
                     assistance, as Shorkley was adjutant &amp; Beaver was aid to Lt Col Bell. We
                     moved on into the woods and turned to the left. Here I was so completely
                     exhausted that I begged Col Bell to give me Lt Beaver as I could not proceed.
                     He told Beaver to take command, and I should stay as his aid until I recovered.
                     We moved on through the woods. More than half of our men lay down completely
                     exhausted &amp; worn out. The rebels kept our range and the round ball &amp;
                     canister were crashing all around us. </p>

                  <pb n="62"/>

                  <p> We had one man killed, Hoffman of Hassenplug’s company and some wounded. He
                     had his whole stomach knocked out with a piece of shell. I struggled on foot by
                     foot. What most made me feel badly was that I should become exhausted just at
                     such a critical time. But many were like officers &amp; men. We at last came to
                     a road: the regiment was sent in to the left. I sat down &amp; lay down - I
                     thought would die. Arnold came along and put a flask of whiskey to my lips and
                     a few swallows revived me. We staid there, sending in all the stragglers. Col Bell sent for
                     the 21st Mass - &amp; they came up in good order - they had stopped and rested.
                     I had a large party of stragglers &amp; started in with them the direction the
                     rest had gone. I met Gen Reno. He told me to keep down toward the left. He
                     appeared to be mad about something. I went to the road &amp; then in. Lt
                     Shorkley came out &amp; head the Mass 21 &amp; lead them into position to the
                     right of us. By the time I got into a big oak tree. I saw Michael Shires co. K.
                     streaking back, asked where his company was - said some were in there - I found
                     there was no company K in battle - a sergt &amp; corporal all that was known to
                     exist &amp; they with Blair. By this time my stragglers had fizzled out
                     wonderfully - I had but two or three of my own men. I came on to my own men
                     just then a few shots were fired, &amp; some one cried out don’t fire, they are
                     our men. So Capt Blair shouted to our color bearer to raise their colors high.
                     We soon found out who they were - the infernalist shower of bullets came in on
                     us that I ever witnessed. Two of my men fell, Lanig, shot in the jaw &amp;
                     Buskirk in the arm. But we gave them pepper back. The colors were a good mark
                     to fire at &amp; I ordered them lowered. The 9th N. York made a charge - come
                     out in beautiful order - but the distance was great and they were exhausted -
                     the rebels played into them with canister &amp; ball - So they came over the
                     fence onto us. I thought the rebels were charging us, &amp; gave my men orders
                     to fix bayonets. I soon saw the red hats however. It did not make our men
                     quiver, - they stood steadily firing. Directly we moved to the right, down
                     along the fence - when the order was given to charge - Down went the fence,
                     over we went pell-mell our flag ahead. Brouse of Hassenplug’s company fell shot
                     through the head. I had just reached a ditch, when I felt a sharp pain in my
                     side, &amp; sickness deathly - fell and was unconscious for a little while -
                     but recovered &amp; staggered on, supported by some of my men. I am yet unable
                     to say whether it was a faint or something struck me. I can’t find any mark.
                     The rebels left. But we were unable to pursue, being too much exhausted. We
                     formed &amp; I had the roll call, &amp; found four men, wounded - some missing
                     - Lanig, Buskirk, McCormick, &amp; Vandine. </p>

                  <head>Saturday 18.</head>
                  <p> We stacked arms &amp; and then got a drink of water. Several houses standing
                     here had been burned, and the fences making dense smoke clear across the
                     rebel's position so that we never saw the smoke of their cannon or musketry,
                     until we got up very close. Our regiment was then moved to the right towards
                     where we had been in the fight &amp; stacked arms in the open field. It began
                     to rain very fiercely, and I went around to see the rebel positions. There were
                     deep ditches along the road used as drains all through this country, which they
                     used as rifle pits, having in front a worn fence partly thrown down &amp; high
                     enough to get them cover. The road along which we advanced was very thickly
                     strewn with rails so that we could not make a charge over it. After making
                     coffee, we were marched to the cover of the wood along the fence where we had
                     fought them, stacked arms and prepared to bivouac for the night. I went down to
                     see our wounded. I came first to the hospital of the Zouaves, where I saw three
                     of their dead lying outside - I was afraid to uncover their faces for fear that
                     I would see Lanig. I went to half-mile further to our hospital. The rebels had
                     played fiercely on our hospital, after the red flag was up round ball &amp;
                     shell. The ground was all ploughed up. They must've seen the fight, for glasses
                     were found by a man in Co. E at the place where their cannon were stationed.
                     Lanig was shot in the jaw - jaw bone broken &amp; tongue cut off &amp; the ball
                     lodged somewhere inside could not be found. Buskirk had a flesh wound through
                     the upper part of me arm. McCormick wounded in the leg, via buckshot
                     apparently, but no hole could be found in pants or drawers. Buskirk asked me to
                     write to his father. Lt Lanig to his wife. He could not talk &amp; could only make some signs. Here Sergt Shuck Co. E came down to carry up Hoffman.
                     Hoffman's brother was along - poor fellow - he took it very hard. I returned to
                     our bivouac ground about nightfall. Beaver had got a gate, and we had a fire -
                     made some coffee, &amp; after discussing the day and especially the
                     incompetency of Major Shawl &amp; the cowardice of Capt. Shawl, we turned over
                     to sleep, expecting to be called early, &amp; that tomorrow we would have a
                     sharp work. I have not slept any for in about a half hour, nine o'clock. Lt.
                     Col. Bell called us all up - the officers &amp; told us we should get our men
                     ready to march in an hour back to Elizabeth City, that are safety depended on
                     our doing it that night - the Gen Reno had reliable information that large
                     reinforcements have been sent for and would be there before morning - the Mass
                     Pickets could hear them coming already - each company butted arms stocked and
                     dismissed; that arrangements had been made to take all the wounded that could
                     be carried with safety, &amp; the rest would have to be left to fall into the
                     hands of the rebels, that the surgeons had cast lots, &amp; the lot fallen on
                     Dr. Warren 21st Mass to stay - Unless the march was made in perfect silence, we
                     would be attacked by their cavalry, which we had seen in the distance &amp;
                     supposed to be 1500 - so we went, &amp; wakend all our men. Explained to them
                     all we deemed necessary to prevent them from imagining more. We had them load
                     such of their pieces as were not,
                     
                     <pb/>
                     the caps taken off. Then Beaver came in
                     &amp; told me the 21st had formed &amp; we were to form immediately. So we got
                     out into the field - It was very dark. The Regiment formed in perfect silence.
                     I cautioned my men that there was no occasion to be alarmed &amp; if anything
                     took place they should stay quietly in ranks until they got orders. That any
                     man that allowed his piece to be discharged, Gen. Reno would shoot &amp; if I
                     found that any one had lost his piece in the morning I would have him punished
                     by the severest punishment. The first Brigade moved first, then our Regt, Mass
                     21 in rear - then two pieces of artillery - then our axe men, who had orders to
                     destroy the bridges after they had passed - &amp; if cavalry came on they were
                     to open out on each side - Col. Howard giving them time - and the artillery
                     would play on them. We moved out onto the road. The first mile was very slow
                     taking an hour or more - then we went faster - and such a march I can give but
                     the faintest description. The roads which were good in the morning, owing to
                     the rain, had become exceedingly bad. It was so dark that you would scarcely
                     see the dark forms of the men in front of you. We were all excessively fatigued
                     by what we had gone through previously. I was particularly unfit for it. But we
                     stuck to it - to the color all the way through - it rained a great part of the
                     time. In the morning, deep chalk holes cut in the road had been filled with
                     wood in corduroy style, &amp; these were scattered and ricked around, so that
                     the passage over them was rather precarious. Men fell down, &amp; sank in the
                     mud - stragglers dropped out exhausted - some threw away their rifles though
                     not many. When we reach the courthouse the glands of my legs swelled &amp; it
                     was agony to stand still. It was near four o'clock. Stragglers came up &amp;
                     joined us. Then I learned to my sorrow, that three of our wounded were left
                     behind. It was agony to me for a while, though I know it could not be helped.
                     In fact all the wounded of our Regt had been left &amp; of the other regiments
                     except the dirty scoundrels the Hawkins Zouares. The surgeon of that Regiment
                     was the medical director of the expedition &amp; he had loaded up only his own
                     men. The Mass 21 had discovered the trick, &amp; got five of theirs along by
                     getting a cart &amp; horse. We were very much chagrined. We left there &amp;
                     got to the River Bank about five o'clock. Here we were very agreeably surprised
                     to see Irvin of Hassenplug's company, who had been wounded in the arm join us.
                     When he found the army had decamped, he knew when Col. Hawkins horse which had
                     been wounded was tied went for it, &amp; rode through - swimming creeks - all
                     the bridges had been broken down. We were glad of it. He said poor Buskirk
                     urged him not to go. We had to wade 
                     <pb n="63"/> 54 out to a plank arrangement
                     taken on the Pilot Boy &amp; put on board the Guide. Fortunately had dry socks
                     in my haversack. Dick got me warm water, &amp; some officers kindly gave me
                     liniment which I rubbed it on my leg - But I could not walk - only hop around.
                     We got some breakfast &amp; went to bed. Yesterday is like a bad dream - I
                     can't remember much about it - I was so used up - slept most of the time -
                     &amp; sat around the stove - &amp; we fought everything over, &amp; traveled it
                     again and again so that I feel perplexed about it. I know it was Sunday the 19
                     just one year since I left home to enter the army. </p>

               <div>
                  <head>Monday 21st </head>
                  <p> we got out the ground outside the lighthouse above the Roanoke Island, &amp;
                     to day about 12 o'clock a tug &amp; the Massasoit came &amp; Took us off. One
                     of our boats brought Stitser, accompany E who had been wounded &amp; left, who
                     told us that about 30 of their wounded &amp; stragglers had left the
                     battlefield at 8 o'clock next morning &amp; came through – that McCormick had
                     come through with them, but had gone on to some other boat. Buskirk &amp; Lanig
                     were unable to move. As we have nothing to do but fight and march this thing
                     over and over again, the sound of being rough &amp; raining fiercely, we have
                     anchored at dark. I think that I will fill up the incidents of the time which I
                     have omitted. We landed in a corn field near Elizabeth City. Some one remarked
                     that was always our luck, but it was not always our luck to have as bright and
                     sunny a day as we have now. The man that lived here had a great number of
                     beehives. They were all robbed when we came back. The retreat could not but be
                     disorderly to some extent, &amp; stragglers had a fair opportunity to leave
                     &amp; plunder. At one place along the road a woman came out &amp; waved a US
                     flag, each company as it came up cheered her. Peter Koser our color corporal,
                     was sick, and Chas Merrill took his place. He stuck to the colors from our
                     landing until we came back to it. I often saw him stagger with fatigue but he
                     stuck to it - through thick and thin - mud &amp; mire - oh it was delightful to
                     me to see him - cool and collected, as if he were walking in the bar. While the
                     other boys were talking of how much they had fired, he quietly remarked to me
                     "Captain I considered it my duty not fire at all," I told him that was right.
                     He showed his courage &amp; coolness and not firing as the color guard never
                     fire - but must be always loaded as I felt the greatest itching to pick up a
                     rifle &amp; had therre not been the most stringent order against officers using
                     any arms, I'm afraid I would have run at it. Beaver told me he had the same
                     feeling, &amp; could hardly refrain from relieving some of the dead of their
                     cartridge box &amp; rifle. Lt Shorkley, who is acting adjutant displayed the
                     most consummate skill &amp; courage in conducting the regiment into their
                     place, and afterwards he took the 21 Mass into their position. Our men praise
                     Lt Beaver very much. He had the company in, &amp; I arrived just before the
                     firing commenced: just in time, I was most heartily glad of it, as I was in the
                     battle and in the charge &amp; only fainted when the enemy had fled.</p>
                  <p>I send this acct to you. You must keep it strictly confidential. Gen Reno has
                     sent the flag of truce requesting the rebels to release on parole our wounded,
                     as that was his way we did at New Berne, &amp; it will no doubt be done. I have
                     been doubting the propriety of the letter to Warden, I wish you wouldn't
                     publish it unless the account's published in the Tribune. I am afraid that it
                     is not right. He might publish the list of killed &amp; wounded &amp; leave the
                     rest until he sees whether other papers published. I don't wish to be
                     compromised. McCormick our wounded corporal got safe to camp.</p>

                  <head>Saturday May 10 1862. </head>
                  <p>This was another lovely day. The weather has been so delightful for the last
                     week, that one does not feel like doing more than he can help - but let life
                     float. We stuck all our tents to air them dry on the ground. We had our tents
                     condemned the other day, and received Sibley tents this afternoon, but not in
                     time to put them up. This forenoon Lt Beaver and I went to see our sick this
                     forenoon. Smith is recovering slowly, &amp; I think Bensinger &amp; [Fike] are
                     too. They are in the Regimental Hospital. Down at the Academy are Knode in the
                     lower ward, Santo, Snyder &amp; Harding in the upper, Knode told us he was so
                     glad we had come to see them. I told him I had been down but couldn’t find him.
                     I told him I had seen Harding the other day “Why wasn’t Harding killed where
                     they attacked us here?” “No,” I said. “Well he lay here just as if he were
                     dead” He evidently was not yet able to separate the real from the dream, and
                     who knows how many fierce and bloody battles he had fought in his deliriousness
                     and how much he suffered in them. Harding, was flushed, but sensible, though
                     the Doctor told us not to talk to him much. My former friend, who mistook
                     thunder for artillery was very talkative, &amp; The Dr would not allow us to
                     talk to him. The “Gaston House” is painted out and “Union House” painted In.
                     Stetson of the Astor House is to keep it. As we passed there Capt Neil
                     recognized, his clerk as one who had been clerk or treasurer of some New York
                     club &amp; found dishonest. He said he would rob him. This afternoon, Charles
                     Mallory and I went across toward the Neuse. Between this &amp; there is a half
                     Moon and Star fort in process of erection, nearly completed. I suppose we will
                     move north west in a week or ten days. This evening we were ordered to send all
                     our sick down to the hospital who would not be able to march in four or five
                     days. I should think the fortifications will be completed in that time. </p>

                  <head>Wednesday 14 </head>
                  <p>The morning was lowering, and this afternoon we had a furious thunderstorm. We
                     had news yesterday of the battles of West Point and Williamsburg, and this
                     afternoon received mail &amp; papers. I had a letter from John of the 7th by
                     which time they had just received letters from us. Col Emory's Brigade with the
                     2nd Maryland went off on some expedition to day. Gen. Burnside returned
                     yesterday, and there was a review of the Cavalry Regiment Col. Wine - it is a
                     splendid regiment. Yesterday we were over looking at two sections of light
                     artillery firing at a target. The other field resembled Camden, and the firing
                     resembled it most, only we were behind instead of in front. They were firing at
                     targets from Fort Totten with 32 pdrs. Thunder what a noise &amp; it called up
                     New Bern - when the 24 &amp; 32 pdrs from the water batteries put in their
                     occasional clamor, above the din and noise of the smaller fry. </p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Thursday. 15. May.</head>
                  <p>This morning the sky was lowering, Beaver and I went down town and bought
                     papers and magazines. We were very lazy, &amp; wondered what we would do if we
                     got marching orders. After dinner Lt Col Bell came over to our tent &amp; said
                     “Boys get ready - we are to march at half past two o clock” We were in a stir -
                     two days provisions that came in wagons. Well that was a relief, but Beaver had
                     just bought a half bushel of clams, and we would have to go without a chance at
                     them. They would spoil before we got back. About two we saw the cavalry Regt.
                     approaching and we all went down to the road to see it. They had had an affair
                     with the rebels 5 miles this side of Trenton in which they had two men killed 6
                     wounded, a 1 Lieut, &amp; 6 men missing. It commenced raining, and we heard the
                     drummers call, and as we looked at the mortar had the cavalry had much of the
                     roads we thought of our march with a rueful visage. An aid rode up shortly
                     afterward with the word “orders countermanded.” We felt rejoiced and feasted on
                     clams at supper. A section of artillery passed and I heard one of our men say
                     “There been at something more than [?] - don’t you see the wheel hanging on
                     behind” and that raised a shout of laughter. </p>

                  <p>Sam Markley returned from Beaufort. He was sent down by the Col to buy ponies.
                     The mares of the ponies are left run on the meadows. When with foal the mares
                     are penned up, until the colt is able to run when it is branded and left run.
                     Sam was a week too soon. All the country there out about the 20th &amp; drive
                     them into pens - there are two pennings as they are called. The north and south
                     - the former 25 miles &amp; the latter ten miles from Beaufort - immediately
                     succeeding one another. The people were doubtful whether there would be any,
                     being afraid our officers would come &amp; take them away. Sam asked their
                     price - they said they had been sold for 15-25 dols - but this year might get
                     one For $45 = 50. Sam told them if they commenced that game they might be sure
                     our officers would come &amp; take them -- if $15 they would sooner pay it than
                     not. </p>

                  <p>So far as I can hear of the affair in the last few days, Col Emory with the
                     cavalry, a section of artillery &amp; infantry were sent up toward Trenton. The
                     Maryland Reg’t up to Pollockville - object to beg some cavalry. Emory returned
                     after a slight skirmish. The 22nd Maryland was hemmed in at Pollockville.
                     Morris was sent up with cavalry &amp; extricated them got back - &amp; was sent
                     out again - after them they not returning - Friday night &amp; Reno [came easy]
                     set out with the 21st Mass - met them returning. Morris rode near 100 miles in
                     24 hours, without get out of saddle almost - the last few miles he had to
                     dismount &amp; get into a wagon. It cleared off, after raining all night until
                     7 o’clock this morning. </p>

                  <p>Very hot, and I am officer of the day. Christy &amp; Stewart had a fight &amp;
                     I put a hand on Christy. A most singular thing has happened in the
                     disappearance of Phillips. He was at roll call last night took his rifle into
                     his tent &amp; that was the last we have seen of him. In the last two or 3 days
                     he has been very quiet - scarcely speaking to any one - in fact ever since the
                     battle of Camden. </p>

               <div>
                  <head>Monday 19th </head>
                  <p>It was very warm during the day, and the evening we had a severe shower. I sent
                     a scouting party to hunt up Phillips. Just after they left word came to us that
                     he was in the guard house of the 10th Conn. about 4 miles from here, on our
                     outposts evidently deranged. He had been put in the guard house the day before
                     and released. During the night he was captured again &amp; I believe knocked
                     down by the sentry. He said that we were going to shoot him, and he wanted to
                     get in to the rebel lines. We sent an ambulance after him &amp; brought him
                     back. The Dr. has had a blister on the back of his neck. We have got into a
                     pretty difficulty. It appears that Shorkley wrote to his brother stating that
                     he was glad Lt Kelly wasn’t along at Camden, for he might have been discredited
                     &amp; his brother was impudent enough to show it and Stenner wrote demanding an
                     explanation. Shorkley took the bull by the horns, and acknowledged he did write
                     it &amp; would stick to it. There was no Co K in the battle - some few of the
                     company were there. Then to cap it the Chronicle has been rifling my private
                     letters or journal and says the only mention of Co K was that Capt Linn saw
                     Michael Shires on the field - evidently meaning to show that the Co was there,
                     but they in connection with the other, interpret that I mean to say nobody but
                     Shires of that company was there. It annoys me exceedingly that our folks
                     should be so impudent as to exhibit it. I warned them frequently about it and
                     now they have got me in to a miserable scrape. Shorkley wrote his brother that
                     he would confine his correspondence to brief matters. I’ll confine mine to my
                     health. </p>

                  <p>The weather is so hot, and camp life so monotonous that it requires the
                     doggedness of a John Quincy Adams to write a journal. The only incident today
                     was the fly of Dick’s tent catching fire. Beaver and I were sitting under the
                     awning between the two when some one gave the yell - “your tent’s on fire.”
                     Beaver seized the wash basin &amp; commenced flinging water from a tub with
                     which we threw slop water - He wasn’t particularly careful as to where he threw
                     it, and as I had got around with a tin pitcher, not another tub, he gave me a
                     few dabs - I did not notice it until after I sat down, the fire out and the
                     narrow escape discussed, when an abominable smell greeted me - Beaver very
                     truly compared it to the smell of a bread and milk poultice which had been
                     three days on an old sore. In the evening we went down town. We stopped near a
                     house when we heard a childish voice accompanying the piano with Dixie. The
                     lady of the house came out and sat on a porch and kept up a talk with the
                     sentry. We overheard her say that they would never give up - that their folks
                     have no navy - when we got away from the sea-board there would be more
                     desperate work. Well said. We all know that both at Roanoke &amp; here our gun
                     boats were of no service except to cover our landing </p>

                  <p>It was exceedingly hot, but rendered pleasant by a going air. We drilled as
                     usual in skirmish, by company. There was a review of artillery on the other
                     side of the river - There was a very brilliant staff and field officer there.
                     Tom Grier up to see us this afternoon. Brobst &amp; some others were sent to
                     Beaufort this afternoon. There seems to be a growing impression that we will
                     have no more fighting in this state, &amp; if what our town paper says is true,
                     we will have the state in the Union before long. However we have to do as the
                     Spaniards do “learn to labor &amp; to wait. </p>

                  <p>The morning was dark and lowering. This afternoon Beaver and I started for
                     town, met Morris who brought us back in his buggy, but a heavy rain came on -
                     we went afterwards between cloud bursting. The rain continued at intervals
                     during the night. We went down again this evening. The steamer Burnside is
                     expected in today, but has not arrived we expect a large mail by her, as the
                     Fortress Monroe mails were sent back to New York. </p>

                  <head>Monday 26.</head>
                  <p>It has been a succession of rainy days. We have a nice cosy time in doors, but
                     cant help thinking of McClellan’s army: it must be dreadful in that low swampy
                     country. Lt Beaver and I strolled around town after morning drill. We saw two
                     of Em French’s whores &amp; several from the crow-nest. Shorkley’s &amp; my
                     visit to those celebrated places is unrecorded, but not unremembered. I never
                     had such fun as the crow-nest afforded. There are three ladies that live down
                     in a house with a porch in front that Beaver and I take occasion to pass every
                     day - they are the only ladies we have seen in town. On Saturday, we met a
                     Pollock from Reading, cousin of John’s wife - a corporal in one of the 4
                     companies of the 48th, which had been left at Hatteras, and came on here the
                     other day. I met him in Philadelphia when Morris &amp; I were there, and little
                     dreamed of meeting him here. I might have seen him at Hatteras had I taken the
                     trouble to go to Merifield but I did not know he was there. </p>

                  <head>Tuesday 27.</head>
                  <p>This was a warm day with pleasant air stirring. The Jersey Blue arrived last
                     night from Hatteras with mails and Gov. Stanley. The Cossack came from
                     Washington N.C. with about 400 released prisoners. They are from all the
                     states, some 54 Pennsylvanians. 2 were here, who had been captured about the
                     1st of July near Martinsburg. They had been taken to Richmond, and during the
                     winter were one in New Orleans and the other in Tuscaloosa. In New Orleans they
                     were closely imprisoned from Parish prison - 4 mo. &amp; 2 days had seen no
                     ground. In Tuscaloosa they had it easier. They were then taken to Salisbury,
                     N.C. where there are several thousand. They said they saw Col. Corcoran there.
                     None of the officers were exchanged. They were all to be sent to Washington
                     N.C. Capt. Pollack whom I met the other day, received a commission as second
                     Lt. in his company. But as he was only a corp. &amp; promoted over the head of
                     the orderly, it appears the Lt. Col. has kept the commission and refused to
                     give it to him. We had one of the most furious rains last night we ever had.
                     Everything was flooded. </p>

                  <head>Wednesday 28.</head>
                  <p>Warm, very warm. We received orders to move our camp across the Trent. The
                     whole 22nd Division is to be encamped across there. We were nicely fixed here,
                     but 2 months is a long time to have a fixed home here. We regret that we won’t
                     have our quiet strolls into town, &amp; the prospect of wood ticks, mosquitos
                     &amp; gnats is not agreeable. We received news from Beaufort that on last
                     Thursday night Phillips had disappeared again and could not be found. He left
                     his shoes in his room, &amp; got up a 12 oclock in the night in in the bath
                     room. They suppose he is drowned but I am inclined to think he has wandered off
                     again &amp; may turn up.</p>

                  <p>A bright pleasant day. We got a mail, small one, &amp; papers to the 25th. We
                     heard through rebel sources that Banks was defeated &amp; 4000 prisoners taken.
                     We see by the papers that Col. Kenly with the 1st Maryland was defeated, &amp;
                     I judged that Banks was in a precarious condition. The Reg’t moved by
                     companies, and 6 companies were moved, so that we stay here tonight yet. Adjt.
                     Bible returned this evening. </p>

                  <p>He looks well. He gives us glowing acct of the refutation of the 51st - He
                     tells a good story on old Brower of Norristown who speaking of the sword Jones
                     sent home, “Just to think I never thought there was much in him and he had to
                     kill the men to take it.” &amp; some other one remarked that in after years he
                     would regret having killed a fellow creature.” Rec’d a letter from John with
                     the news that May Husburgh had eloped with Lineweaver. It is hard because some
                     of the members of M H’s church at Lebanon are involved in it, and it will never
                     be pleasant to remain there - It is an outrage because she is only 17 and he 35
                     years old. Stolen to from our house. John is particularly indignant on that
                     account. The minister who married them, they are determined to prosecute, &amp;
                     wish for conspiracy. Tom Grier said that Gov. Stanley has commenced his reign
                     by suppressing Colyers night schools, and the [d---] are in terror because It
                     is reported that he said they would all be remanded to their masters. One said
                     he would put a knife in his gut before he would go back to his Massa. This is
                     all right. It takes all old Abes Wisdom to counteract the rascally radicalism
                     of such men as Phelps and Hunter, who are, by the way, among the best Generals
                     in the service. The 17 Mass returned from picket duty. I understand that the
                     whole of the 1st Division are to be encamped here. </p>

                  <head>Friday 30.</head>
                  <p>The day was very warm. We took down our tents &amp; packed, “waiting for the
                     wagon” when about 9 o’clock the wagon master came, and told us he had orders
                     from Quarter master Hall not to haul any more over the road until it was
                     repaired, and that he would furnish transportation to the river, and on the
                     other side of the river. If my tents hadn’t been down I wouldn’t have budged -
                     we asked "what then - is there a boat”, well his instructions didn’t go any
                     further. Some peoples was mad, and an indefinite amount of hard swearing done.
                     We expected this from Hall, but yet we couldn’t restrain our indignation. Our
                     Quartermaster starts off with the wagon-master to see about a boat. Directly
                     the teams came, &amp; we of course thought there was a boat - loaded up -
                     Beaver went with the teams - I started with the company by the road. It must be
                     5 miles - we crossed the Trent by the Bridge, part of which we knocked down
                     when we went through the draw with the Vidette, and up the left Bank of the
                     Trent. Within a mile or perhaps less, a deep creek <pb/> joins the Trent, then
                     runs along it up, with perhaps 500 yards of land between, covered with grass
                     like Timothy, then makes a bend like a horseshoe &amp; comes back again –
                     across the neck it is but a few hundred yards, but the peninsula contains
                     several hundred acres – on the peninsula is our camp: covered with grass &amp;
                     shaded with pines - the banks covered with luxuriant foliage of pines and trees
                     &amp; flowers </p>

                  <p>The stately cypress, made venerable by the gray-beards of Spanish moss – The
                     creek is very deep. Oh it is a lovely place. But we waited long and wearily.
                     The others have their tents pitched, and our prospect seemed to be to roost on
                     the trees or spread on the grass. Just at dusk and we saw a big <pb/> flat come
                     floating up. Polled with long poles – we had a great time unloading – everybody
                     cross – sharpers looking out for boards - men quarreling over their piles – for
                     boards are considered the luxuries of the camp. The tents were hastily pitched
                     in the dark, &amp; we all took a good sleep. </p>

                     division. We went as far as the 48th Camp at the Bridge, when it was raining
                     furiously – we got word that the review was postponed until four o'clock. The
                     rest trudged back and I went to town with Capt. Mitchell. He is a highly
                     cultivated and talented man, &amp; I spent a very agreeable day. We went to see
                     Lt. Van Buren Military Sec of Gov Stanley. Stanley is a medium sized man with
                     sandy gray hair, thin &amp; not very prepossessing in his looks. I returned
                     with the Capt to 51 N.Y. Camp, &amp; met the Reg't in the afternoon when the
                     review took place. Hot and tiresome. I met Capt. McChesney who was wounded and
                     just returned – it appears that <pb/>
                     <fw>May 31. continued</fw> Capt. Mitchell had met Capt McChesney just after the
                     battle, had rendered him some assistance and given him a drink of whiskey out
                     of his flask. They had not met since - so we talked the whole battle over again
                     and I think gleaned more of it from this intelligent talk than I knew of it
                     before - &amp; could understand, because we were but a few hundred yards behind
                     them. Then they found mutual acquaintances in New Jersey. We were reviewed by
                     the Gov, Burnside and a very brilliant staff. There was no show, but everything
                     looked uncommonly substantial and in good fighting order. Oh, what a hot march
                     home - everybody hot &amp; tired - out of humor, and swearing enough to take
                     out hats off. </p>

                  <head>Sunday June 1.</head>
                  <p>We had a sermon from Mr. Mallory in a grove of pines and we lounged through the
                     day - it was excessively hot - we put up the tent sides and counted take every
                     breath of air. The pleasant places have their annoyances - wood ticks abound -
                     a reddish brown bug, about the size of a bed bug, which plugs its nipper into
                     the flesh and cant be pulled out, you have to cut them off, leaving the nipper
                     stuck in. there are alligators in the creek and these cypress swamps. Whew,
                     what a nice time we’ll have. </p>

                  <p>The pay master came this morning and we were mostly engaged in receiving the
                     green-backs and fixing up the tents. I hear that Phillips was taken up by the
                     pickets of the New Jersey 9, but could not hear anything further of him.</p>

                  <head>Tuesday 3.</head>
                  <p>We went to town. We have a boat and boats crew, and it is a pleasant ride down.
                     We were fortunate in going today, by being enabled to see the review of the 1st
                     division. It was really splendid, the pioneers had leather or linen aprons -
                     the long train of artillery, the savage, devilish looking marine battery, drawn
                     by sailors &amp; the cavalry.</p>
                  <p>Made a spectacle such as I have never yet witnessed. In display it far exceeded
                     ours. they are all Yankee regiments - Massachusetts. This then you know, they
                     call us the fighting division </p>

                  <p>It rained and stormed fiercely all day. We were to have a brigade drill, but it
                     was of course postponed</p>

                  <head>Tuesday 5th.</head>
                  <p>Dark and lowering with some rain. I went to town having some business and
                     anxious to have news, but had to return without hearing any. We did hear that
                     Washington N.C. was burned, and that they commenced fighting at Richmond, but
                     had to cease on account of the rain.</p>
               </div>

               <div>
                  <head>Thursday 7th.</head>
                  <p>Yesterday it was raining, and about 10 o’clock I received an order to be at New
                     Bern at 12 o’clock to sit on a board of survey of foreign stores. I got a
                     dug-out of Grossonfer &amp; took two of my men to row, - the oars light &amp;
                     the blocks broken off - waves running high, and wind blowing strong southwest -
                     we had a hard time getting down half of the way, we ran to shore and poled. Lt
                     Wright &amp; Goodridge 57 N.Y. were the other two. The latter was away North.
                     We looked at the rotten hay &amp; oats and adjutants today. Lt. Morris was
                     substituted. The schooner had been chartered by the gov. of Dibble at New York
                     - he slipped in private stores, &amp; 40 bales of hay were left on deck. She
                     sprung a leak off Hatteras &amp; was near sinking - both hay inside &amp;
                     outside was damaged. We reported; however, that Dibble who had put the store in
                     &amp; smuggled them into a port not open ought to be held liable at least for
                     the 40 bales outside - for though they would have been damaged even if put in
                     there, he ought to have put them inside &amp; it was a question whether by
                     displacing the forage with other smuggled goods would not make him liable for
                     the whole. He is such a mean old curse, he ought to be caught up. It rained
                     this evening and I had to walk up. This morning as we were going down the
                     guards of the H com. discharged their pieces, &amp; the minces with an angry
                     [hing] came into the water all around us. Though we know what it was, it was a
                     scared and mad party. Worse scared than in battle, &amp; we have then many a
                     hearty imprecation. Dick was so scared he was going to jump into the Creek. We
                     got a mail from the North with news of the battle of Hanover Court house and
                     oak grove, &amp; evacuation of Corinth. Rec’d a letter from John after the 28th
                     of June.</p>

                  <head>Sunday 8th</head>
                  <p>I was officer of the day as usual on Sunday. It rained during the night and was
                     cool and pleasant today. Morris was here this afternoon. He told us that Gen.
                     Burnside had gone to Norfolk yesterday, by the way of the Dismal swamp canal.
                     Several of our gun boats have gone through and back. We had an elegant dinner —
                     roast pork — boiled ham tomatoes, potatoes &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>Monday 9th</head>
                  <p>The day was dark and lowering, and in the evening set in rain and rained all
                     the night. We had a brigade drill this afternoon at 4 o’clock down near the 21
                     Mass camp. The 1st brigade were drilling there too, and Gen Reno was looking on
                     &amp; reviewed us afterwards. Just after dinner Lynch Hassenplug &amp; I went
                     over to a plantation across the creek for honey &amp; mutton. It was fun to see
                     the [n----] destroying the “guns” — a bunch of bees got in their wool. This
                     plantation is immense and poverty stricken. We got a large mail. </p>

                  <head>Tuesday 10th </head>
                  <p>Having rained all night, we had no drill— until afternoon we had Regimental
                     drill. Santo and Bobst returned from Beaufort. They say that Phillips has not
                     yet been found. They had heard a report of a man found floating without shoes
                     and stockings, answering to his description and then again they heard that he
                     had been taken on by the 9th New Jersey Pickets — but nothing definite. Capt
                     Mitchell &amp; Capt Simms 51st New York were here to see me today.</p>

                  <p>This was a pl read a paper of the 6th.. There was nothing doing at all. Dined
                     as the Union aeasant day. I went to town with Smith McCormick and Cozer. I met
                     Tom Grier &amp; read a paper of the 6th.. There was nothing doing at all. Dined
                     as the Union &amp; got back to camp for dress parade. I saw Dr Cutter and told
                     him how our men were used in regard to rations at Beaufort. He intimated he had
                     no control &amp; that the party that were in there were at fault. I believe I
                     will raise a row to Gen. Reno. </p>

                  <head>Thursday 12.</head>
                  <p>This morning I went down to the 48th Penna, to take their affidavits on their
                     claims for back pay. I walked down &amp; back - about 4 miles in all — I dined
                     with the Major — but they never so much as said “Thank You.” They never asked
                     me whether I charged fees, or anything about it — never expressed any regret
                     for my long walk in the broiling sun — it sort of astounded me. Afterwards they <pb/>

                     <note>Linn gives the wrong day of the week for the continuation of June 12 and
                        June 13</note> treated me very cordially - but it was essentially dutch.
                     Shorkley got quite indignant at it. While there I saw the first Locamotive come
                     up from Beaufort, and cross over the new bridge. We all cheered it as it
                     passed. At 3 o'clock we marched to the 51st Camp to Brigade drill. Ferrero is a
                     fine drill officer. Gen Foster and staff, with Gen [Wauman] Adjt. Gen of Rhode
                     Island - who comes, I hear, to present the sword voted to Gen. Burnside, by the
                     Legislature of Rhode Island - and we had an impromptu review. In riding from
                     the right to the front Gen Foster put his horse to his speed &amp; the little
                     militia General was well put to - he looked as much scared as Gilpon &amp; his
                     pants crawled up to his crotch - &amp; he had to get off to have them pulled
                     down. It goes easy to drill by brigade but the awkwardness of it at first shows
                     the necessity of men being drilled in masses. Gov. Stanley with Lt. Van Heusen
                     rode into camp this evening just as we returned, adn appeared pleased with this
                     quiet beauty. Last night Beaver and I staid up until one o'clock to see the
                     Eclipse. We watched it until the moon was wholly eclipsed &amp; then retired.
                     It is a hard matter to stay up late. It goes hard with me. Lt Beaver is officer
                     of the guard, and has to be up this evening or tonight. Shorkley has gone to
                     town to a meeting of Masons. I have made the beds &amp; spent the evening
                     alone, as Dick has skedaddled too. The moon is full and our camp is lovely.

                  <p>it was very warm toward noon, but in the afternoon breeze sprang up, as it
                     generally does. This for noon we commenced drilling in the bayonet exercise -
                     This afternoon we had regimental, just after dress parade we were greeted with
                     a mail – I rec'd one letter of John of June 6th. Though it gets excessively hot
                     at noon, I think that we will always have a breeze in the afternoon. I took off
                     my leather collar &amp; commenced wearing paper collars – I think from that I
                     caught a cold settled in my throat, which annoys me very much. I haven't felt
                     anything like it since our march to Camden. It is singular how easy one catches
                     cold in this climate. I never was bothered so in inclement Pennsylvania. The
                     warmer the climate the thicker the stockings is the old Travelers rule. The
                     mosquitoes bother us at night considerably now. </p>

                  <head>June 21. Saturday 1862. </head>
                  <p>It was a warm pleasant day. Lt Col Joshua K Sigfried 48 P. came here to make
                     his affidavit for back pay a very pleasant gentlemanly man. There are many good
                     things happen in camp that need the surroundings to fully appreciate.
                     Bachenheimer is a little fellow in my company, they call him a Jew - he is a
                     printer by trade, and corresponded for a Scranton paper. His bravery is rather
                     doubtful as in our battles he always got tired and lagged. He is the butt of
                     his mess &amp; they torment him about his correspondence especially - and about
                     sketching his various scenes - which is especially pointed because he was never
                     present. Today, some of his men came into his tent and said, “Bachenheimer made
                     one mistake in his sketch of the review and sword presentation. Bachy, as they
                     call him, said nothing, but one of course asked What it was - Why he has
                     sketched Gen Burnside with hair on his head. Gen Burnside is bald. We all have
                     our hair cut very short, and some show very considerable baldness, as my own
                     for instance, And the saying is, that one has his hair cut like Gen Burnside.
                     George Arnold leader of our Band is full of fun. His imitation of the Irish is
                     rich. He wears his mustache, about the size of a calfs tail, and makes a very
                     odd appearance. He said he wore whiskers in Norristown. An old fellow then, who
                     loved to get off a good theory on others but didn’t on himself met him one day,
                     says he George - get shaved - why - oh you're a good looking man but youlook
                     ridiculous you ought to have a clean face like me - come I’ll pay for a shave -
                     well come along says George - And as they were going along George asked him why
                     he disliked his whiskers - Why, says the old fellow, you look so much like as
                     if you had swallowed a jackass, and left the tail stick out. Well, says George,
                     do you know what your clean shaved face looks like, No, what? Why you look as
                     if you had swallowed a tail and left the jackass stick out. The old man stopped
                     - thought while - Well I’ll treat George.</p>

                     also of the 19th. Co A had a special Inspection - $5 to be given to one who had
                     arms and accoutrements in the best condition: This was the Springfield rifles.
                     They were most admirably gotten up. </p>

                     bands play at intervals of rest &amp; once all the bands joined in playing Hail
                     Columbia. Morris was here this evening and told me he thought we could get a
                     leave of absence next week.</p>

                  <head>Wednesday 24.</head>
                  <p>I went to New Bern this morning with Lt. Kelly to get him a leave of absence.
                     We went to Gen. Reno who told us that in the present state of affairs he had
                     concluded to give no leaves of absence or furloughs that if affairs at Richmond
                     turned out as they expected, in about two weeks they intended to give leaves of
                     absence to one or perhaps two officers of each company. As I was going down
                     town I met an officer of the 48th who said the his field and staff wished to
                     make some affidavits before me: I said I would meet them at any time between
                     that and four o’clock at the Gaston House. He fixed twelve. About that time he
                     came in a buggy with an invitation to dine with the Col. I refused to go and he
                     then said they would come up to our camp tomorrow. They've got to come to me
                     after this. Just after this there leapt of a schooner Moses B Something, came
                     to me to make an affidavit to his log. He had been sent by Capt. Biggs out to
                     our camp. I told him that I was as only Com. for Pennsylvania - but as if was
                     for the Government to pay on - &amp; I’m the only civil personage in North
                     Carolina I suppose it will answer. When I refused fees he appeared to be
                     astonished, but I told him that so long as I was in the pay of the United
                     States, I did not <pb/>
                     <fw>June 24. 1862 cont. </fw> consider it right to make money off [torn] ... Em
                     French's whore-house has blown off [torn] ... There were a lot of officers
                     there – she [torn] blackguarding them out of the windows [torn] calling them
                     damned Yankee sons of bitches &amp; came out onto the porch with a revolver –
                     Fired three shots rapidly, shooting a handsome young officer who was standing
                     quietly in the middle of the street, in the abdomen. The soldiers were
                     gathering and about gutting the house and preparing to hang Em French on the
                     tree, when Robert Marshall Col Kurtz arrived – arresting four whores – handsome
                     girls – Marching them down the middle of the street to the jail, and toting the
                     dozen officers off as witnesses. Fred Eweine said this: he is one of those
                     fellows that is always about when anything was going on. John Kenedy &amp; Jim.
                     Gibson are such characters. To be shot by a whore – the officers that were
                     inside – one standing on the porch with her – it's very disgraceful. Col. Kurtz
                     in his wrath let out some forcible expressions about the way the house had been
                     upheld. I met Sgt. Grassmine. He is a sort of detective in town. He told me he
                     caught too small boatloads of salt going across the Neuse into the rebels
                     lines. It rained this evening. I talked to the old [d----] who said he was 104
                     years old. He looks very ancient. His hair is not grizzled much, but his toe
                     nails &amp; finger nails are scaly. I asked him whether he remembered the duel
                     between Haight and Stanley - he said he did well – the first fire Stanley was
                     shot in the sleeve of his coat, and it came out his shoulder. The second
                     Stanley shot straight through the breast. Haight then wanted them to raise him
                     up to fire a third time, but the second refused. He said the time was fixed and
                     people went down from his county – 16 miles from New Bern to see the battle. He
                     could not tell me where it took place. He said on this place his son [?] [?]
                     &amp; it was bought by Jim Niley who afterwards fell in a duel with some one I
                     have forgotten who. He [torn] Jack Stanley fell dead in the court House of
                     Raleigh as he was taking some oath. He always said he was going to swear to a
                     lie. He was a short old bachelor Jack Stanley was - he never was nobody after
                     that - he told him often that he was no man after that- he had often ferried
                     Jack Stanley over the river to go to Trenton to court. He evidently meant that
                     he was struck with paralysis - as he speaks of talking to him afterwards - as
                     was the fact </p>

                  <head>Wednesday 25.</head>
                  <p>It was a fine pleasant day. The morning we spent at bayonet exercise - this
                     afternoon Regimental drill. Col Nagle was here to make his affidavit for pay -
                     he is an essential dutchman though fine looking and said to be a fine drill
                     master. He has a queer high toned voice with a squawk to it- he pronounces
                     rather oddly - speaking of some thing he said it was his “Karculation”. Capt
                     Pollock was here – now a first Lieutenant – the commission Lt Col. Sigfried
                     sent back was returned and the Capt and 1st Lieutenant resigning 3 days after
                     he received a commission as 1st Lieutenant. Lt. Col. Sigfried refused to assign
                     him to duty, but Col. Nagele took it in hand and assigned him. He talked of
                     resigning, but I advised him not do it. There is a feeling because he as a
                     corporal was promoted over the heads of sergeants. Vandine was announced as 1st
                     sergeant &amp; Billy Allison as sergeant – corporal not filled. </p>

                  <p>A pleasant day – air stirring. We had Brigade drill but as I was officer of the
                     day I did not go. I was busy too preparing applications for our officers for
                     backpay. Been reading Mackenzie's life of Dr Magin. He reminds me very much of
                     Dr Elder at Philadelphia except the doctor is not near so learned. </p>

                  <p>This was a fine day – hot however in the middle of it – yet giving us a breeze.
                     Bayonet exercise as usual; and this afternoon, Regimental skirmish drill:
                     deployed by wings, I was senior captain of the left wing and in command of it.
                     We drilled by the bugle - then Captain Bell gave us a splendid explanation of
                     skirmish drill with bayonet exercise. The artillery were practicing at target
                     and we were amused with the bursting of shells. Beaver and Sharkley went to
                     town. We got a mail that came by way of Norfolk. Old stuff, but some papers are
                     as late as the 24th. We get our letters by way of New York. Rec'd a paper
                     published by [? &amp; Hause?] at Mifflinburg </p>

                  <head>Saturday 28.</head>
                  <p>A cloudy day of rain this afternoon. Lt. Foster Co. E returned from home -
                     brought me a letter from John. He came on the Cossack which brought us a large
                     mail. I had a letter from Em Hayes and one from [?] &amp; Hummel acknowledging
                     his receipt of the $60 we sent for the purpose of getting the body of Lanig
                     home. Old Christ the sutler was very particular in weighing some cheese for
                     John Miller this evening. Miller told him he was as particular as old
                     [Pehoch?]. How’s that. Why he would brush the flies’ feet when they came out
                     the sugar box for fear they’d waste it. Charley Shriner, after whom the
                     “Shriner guards” Co. E are called sent them a demi john of whisky, &amp; this
                     evening, Co. E feels good on this glass of grog. There seems to be preparations
                     for a march. We are ordered to report our effective men for a sharp march - the
                     reliant ones number 578, though I could report bare 30 rank &amp; file. We were
                     ordered to have 60 rounds of ammunition each. I think it is merely
                     precautionary. We have papers to the 25th,but they are bare of the news we wait
                     for though they tell us of victory at White River &amp; its sad accident on the
                     Mound City. Did not we know that the rebels lie so, we would fear a repulse at
                     James Island. No. 6. We have sent all our sick to the hospital. </p>

                  <head>Sunday 29.th June. </head>
                  <p>It was warm and we had a shower this evening. About noon the Col. sent for the
                     Commanders of Companies and read our orders - to be ready at 8 hours notice to
                     march. 60 rounds of cartridge &amp; 30,000 in the wagons - 3 days provisions in
                     haversacks - 4 on wagons the latter only to be coffee, hard bread, and salt. To
                     take none but those are capable of doing and rapid marching: tents to be left
                     standing - guards to be of convalescents, who are to strike tents, and have
                     them taken to town, to be put upon a schooner to be designated. This about the
                     substance - only officers are not to be allowed any transportation. They may
                     have one packhorse to regiment, but it is to be considered private property
                     though allowed to go along in the train. 4 camp kettles &amp; 4 mess pans
                     allowed to a company &amp; 3 wagons to a Regiment. This looks like a mysterious
                     raid somewhere, and we have spent the day in various discussions - we know
                     about as much about it as we always did - is probably a diversion in favor of
                     McClellan. We had a sermon this evening by Mr. Mallory he standing before his
                     tent and we seated on the grass. I noticed an unusually large attendance, which
                     probably the prospects of a march effected. It put me in mind of Isaac Beck,
                     one of my company, as he told the story himself, at the battle of Camden, in
                     the midst of it, bullets raining all around, he pulled out his handkerchief to
                     wipe the sweat off his face, &amp; jerked some cards out, which fell on the
                     ground. He looked at them awhile and thought it would be a bad thing if he were
                     shot, and was found with the cards in his jacket, &amp; he was going to throw
                     them away - when the thoughts struck him he had just paid the Sutler 50 cts for
                     them &amp; he thought he would risk it a while yet anyhow - so he picked up
                     those that fell on the ground. He told it in a funny dutch way. I remember at
                     Roanoke we were among the last regiments that moved up, and the road was
                     scattered full of cards. Billy Allison remarked that we're getting
                     conscientious - This was as we were going into the battle. I sort of hate this
                     very rapid march, this hot weather - but as I have stood others pretty severe I
                     know I can go through it. We were mustered as of tomorrow by the Col. Capt.
                     Blair's company has been sent for - their baggage arrived this evening.</p>

                  <p>We spent the day in preparation and target shooting. We had a man David Clark,
                     North Co transferred to us from the 22nd Md. We have a common [?] from Peter
                     Schmidt, one of our company - who came out on bayonet Drill - Darn it if Reno
                     understand!</p>
